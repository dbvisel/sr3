## The First Archaeological Excavation on the Plain of Singapore: Parliament House Complex, November 1994-January 1995

*By Goh Geok Yian, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, and John Miksic, Nanyang Technological University Singapore & National University of Singapore*

<hr />

During most of the 20th century, the block of land between North Bridge Road, High Street, Old Parliament House (now in 2023 renamed the Arts House), and the Singapore River, measuring about 200 by 150 metres, was occupied by two-storey shophouses. In the 1980s these were demolished; in the empty space thus created a hawker and a car park were temporarily established. 
The car park and hawker centre were closed in early 1994 in order to prepare for construction of Singapore’s Parliament House Complex (PHC). At this time, a picture of life in the 14th\-century palace complex of Singapore was beginning to emerge from archaeological research on Fort Canning Hill, but nothing was known about the rest of pre-colonial Singapore. The impending development of PHC provided an important opportunity to conduct research in a new part of old Singapore. 
From an archaeological point of view, the future PHC site was prime real estate. If Fort Canning had been the ancient ceremonial centre of the isle, the holy mountain of Temasik, it was logical to infer that the riverbank would have been the area where the bulk of the population lived and pursued everyday activities such as manufacturing and trade. 
The right bank of the Singapore River in 1819 was a swamp, which only became habitable when a small hill which stood handily nearby was levelled and its soil used to create dry land which by 1825 was already called Kampong China (“Chinatown” in Malay). It is unlikely that anyone lived there in ancient times; this impression has not been altered by excavations which have revealed only 19th-century remains in that area. 
The Principal Investigator at Fort Canning, John Miksic, contacted the Clerk of Parliament to inquire whether it would be possible to conduct research on the site. The Clerk of Parliament very kindly consented to the request, and established a connection between Dr. Miksic and the contractor in charge of the site. 
The Public Works Department (PWD) had already commissioned the excavation of two pits about 2 by 2 metres and 1.5 metres deep at the site to investigate the nature of the subsoil. These pits provided a useful window into the past of this area of downtown Singapore (see Figure 1). The soil in the sides of the pits displayed a jumble of colonial period artefacts, including bricks and stones which were remnants of old buildings in a soil matrix consisting of clay of various shades of yellow-brown. Beneath them was a black sandy layer unlike anything seen in the Fort Canning site. The black colour seemed to be the remains of ashes from wood fires, but without further research it was impossible to tell how old they were; they could have formed at any time before the late 19th century, when the shophouses were built.

The Clerk of Parliament kindly gave consent for a test excavation under the auspices of the Singapore History Museum (now the National Museum). The spot chosen for the test excavation was located near the corner of High Street and North Bridge Road, furthest away from the old Supreme Court building. Construction vehicles were entering and leaving the site near the old Parliament House, making it impractical to carry on archaeological research there. The northeast corner of the site was outside the area which was affected by the early phase of construction (Miksic 2013: fig. 5.27).
A brief period was initially granted for the research. The authorities later extended this period due to the importance of the initial discoveries. Financial support from the Singapore History Museum made it possible to hire a backhoe to conduct an excavation in order to determine as quickly as possible whether the site had any archaeological significance.
On November 21, 1994, at 9:30 am, a team consisting of Prof. Miksic, Shah Alam Mohd Zaini, Goh Geok Yian, and Kristina Gardin, observed as a small backhoe began to dig a test trench (Miksic 2013: Acknowledgements, figs. 3, 4; fig. 5.28).

At first the results were minimal. Excavation throughout the morning removed the upper layer of soil, which revealed nothing of archaeological interest. In the afternoon, the backhoe reached the top of the black sandy layer observed in the profiles of the PWD pits. The significance of this layer was not yet understood. 
On November 22, the mechanical excavator expanded the trench. The course of the trench was determined in part by the presence of substantial stone building foundations which the mechanical digger was not capable of demolishing, and partly by soil features which indicated that modern construction had disturbed the lower soil layer. 
The first section of the trench extended for 8 metres toward High Street until it came within a metre of the sidewalk. Next a section was dug parallel to High Street. Eventually Miksic decided to extend the trench parallel to North Bridge Road, toward the Singapore River. 
Due to the loose consistency of the soil, the maximum depth which could be excavated without creating the danger of collapsing trench walls was 1.5 metres. At a depth of one metre, rubble from 19th- and early 20th-century buildings appeared. As the digger began to remove the next 25 centimetres of soil, the black sand exposed in the PWD pits emerged. The implication of this sudden and clear transition was unknown, so the operator was asked to probe deeper into the black layer rather than levelling off a large area. If this black layer were sterile, that would have been the end of the project.
A few minutes after the mechanical digger began to scrape off another 25 centimetres, sherds of earthenware pottery appeared. We were not able to determine the date of these artefacts, but they were consistent with a premodern layer. The backhoe then levelled off the top of a larger area of the black sand, after which the archaeologists carefully scraped this layer with trowels. Fragments of Chinese stoneware, possibly premodern, quickly appeared. Finally a sherd of green porcelain appeared; this artefact could be positively identified as belonging to the same type as 14th\-century Chinese ceramics found on Fort Canning.
The excavator then exposed more of the top of the black sand layer, in which more sherds were visible. Some yellow-brown clay began to appear mixed with the black sand. It seemed at that moment that the black sand might be a small area of ancient soil surrounded by more recent deposition. The mechanical digger was asked to turn around and dig in the opposite direction, toward North Bridge Road. The black sand quickly reappeared. The yellow-brown clay turned out to be a minor disturbance in the midst of an extensive well-preserved layer of soil deposited in the 14th\-16th centuries.
By the end of the day, the mechanical digger had excavated enough topsoil to create a space large enough for a group of people to work in. On November 23 locations T1 and T2 were excavated by hand by Miksic, Shah Alam Mohd. Zaini, Goh, Kristina Gardin, and Julia Oh. Trench T1 yielded ancient Chinese coins, inlaid glass, and a stoneware lid. Finds in Trench T2 included a unique bronze bell (see Figure 4\) and coins. On November 24, work continued in T1, and investigations began in Squares 1, 3, and 4\. All showed promise of yielding significant precolonial discoveries.

The project then proceeded to the second phase, in which volunteers were activated to explore the Temasek-period stratum. This development made it possible to explore an area of Singapore where no remains had previously been reported. The *Malay Annals/Sulalatus-salatin* mentions the palace on the hill and the “Old Malay Wall” which protected the palace and temple complex on Fort Canning and the city of Singapura, but does not describe the city where the bulk of the population lived and worked. For the first time, it became possible to use archaeology to fill in this major blank in Singapore’s history.
The mechanical digger excavated a trench 9 metres long parallel to North Bridge Road, starting near the corner of North Bridge and High Street and running toward the Singapore River. About 50 metres from the riverbank, the excavator encountered a large pit full of wooden planks and other remains of 19th-century buildings. Old maps show that a road called North Boat Quay ran along the riverbank from North Bridge Road to Empress Place. This evidence strongly suggested that the area along the riverbank had been disturbed by recent development, so the trench was ended at this spot.
The excavation at PHC continued from November 1994 to January 1995, corresponding to the university vacation when students and supervisors were available. The site of the excavation is now a grassy lawn beneath which is an underground carpark. No more research can be conducted on this site.	 
Weather conditions during this excavation were far from optimal. The period from November to January is normally the rainiest period of the year in Singapore, and the 1994-95 rainy season was particularly stormy. The trench profiles composed of sand were in constant danger of collapse. Volunteers worked under jerry-rigged shelters consisting of plastic sheets supported by bamboo poles. When the rain stopped and the sun shone, the temperature in the trench reached 40 degrees Celsius. 
Despite the weather and the limited period available for excavation, the locations of artefacts found were carefully recorded vertically in ten-centimetre-thick units (spits), and horizontally within squares averaging four metres on a side. The excavation was nearly 50 metres long (from northeast to southwest) and six metres wide. The black sand layer in the trench averaged 50 centimetres thick. Unfortunately time ran out before it was possible to complete the excavation of the entire trench, so artefact density cannot be precisely calculated. Several postholes were also discerned, including one well-preserved example in Square VII, which appeared at 30 centimetres below the top of the precolonial layer, but the excavation was not extensive enough to use these postholes to calculate the dimensions or shapes of ancient wooden structures.

The trench revealed dense remains of ceramics and metal, many representing types not found on Fort Canning Hill. Some blankets of sherds were recorded. These must have been places where rubbish was disposed of.

The bottom of the black sand layer was reached in some areas, beneath which the sand colour changed from black to pale yellow. This layer was sterile. In one unit, Square 12, artefacts were found at a depth of 2 metres, 10 centimetres beneath the groundwater surface, at the edge of a white clay soil deposit which appeared to underlie the sandy soil. This white clay too was sterile. 
Chinese porcelain in the excavation dates the top of the black sand to the end of the 16th century, and the bottom to the late 13th century. This contrasts with the Fort Canning/Bukit Larangan site, which was abandoned just before 1400, probably because of an attack aimed at defeating Parameswara, a usurper who escaped and later founded Melaka. PHC was probably inhabited a few years before Fort Canning Hill, and continued to be inhabited for some time after the hill was abandoned. 
The density of artefacts and the thickness of the ancient stratum at PHC were nearly as great as those on Fort Canning. Differences in the types of artefacts recovered at the two sites are clearly linked to the different functions of the sites. The Keramat Iskandar Shah site on Fort Canning was a workshop making items of gold and glass for a royal and religious complex; Parliament House Complex was an industrial and possible habitation area. Remains of industry consist of artefacts related to metal working, especially the production of artefacts related to fishing. These are made of copper and iron (Shah Alam Mohd. Zaini 1997). 
The PHC excavation added a new perspective to our knowledge of ancient Singapore. It demonstrated that the riverbank had been densely inhabited, and that this habitation had extended at least as far from the river as High Street. At this time (2023), PHC and CCT (Colombo Court) are the only two sites excavated in the area between Fort Canning Hill and the sites along the former seacoast (Empress Place \[EMP\], the Padang \[SCC\], St. Andrew’s Cathedral \[STA\]). Further excavations may help to clarify the role of industries in ancient Singapore. One unanswered question concerns the size of the metal-working zone, and whether there were other industries or other specialised activities in the area near Stamford Road.

### History of the Site
It was mentioned earlier in this report that the foundations of shophouses were uncovered during the early stage of the excavation. Archival research on the location yielded a number of maps and diagrams, the earliest of which is dated 1879\. The map shows the plots of land available for lease in the North Bridge Road and High Street area. The PHC excavation area is located in unit No. 216, which had been subdivided into two parts (see MR1/1138/3 “Leases in the North Bridge Road, High Street and the Singapore River area”). The plot of land appears not have been leased at the time the plan was drafted; if it had been, the tenant would have been able to lease the plot for 999 years. 
There is an earlier survey map which was printed in 1922, but the survey was made in 1842, commissioned by the Surveyor-General, Federated Malay States (F.M.S.) and Straits Settlement (S.S.). A detailed examination of this 1922 publication of Singapore Town (see SP002113 “Plan of the Town of Singapore and its Environs”) shows that in 1842, there were no structures on this site. 
A couple of plans of new shophouses at the corner of North Bridge Road and High Street, dated 1904, shows the façades and ground plans of shophouses located at the corner of the two roads. These appear to be shophouses constructed on the opposite side of High Street from the area Miksic and team excavated in 1994-1995 \[see 6955-1/1904 “New Shophouses (Ground & 1st Floor Plan)” and 6955/1904 “New Shophouses (Key Plan, Elevation & Section)”\] based on the orientation of the building and the labels of North Bridge Road and High Street. 
The 1936 “Singapore Street Plans” (see National Archives of Singapore Accession No. D2016\_000171) shows a very small section of the southeast corner of North Bridge Road and High Street. There is a row of shophouse parallel to High Street and oriented northeast-southwest. These are units numbering 47-63 as can be seen on the map. 
The 1950 photomap of Singapore Town (see National Archives of Singapore Accession No.: SP000991) shows the same row of shophouses at the corner of North Bridge Road and High Street. This photomap provides a further piece of information: there is a back lane separating the row of shophouses from another row of shophouses which ran parallel to North Bridge Road, but are oriented northwest-southeast. The trench excavation of the PHC site did not reveal the presence of this back lane. The same back lane and shophouses are shown on two other survey maps in 1955 and 1958 respectively (see “G.I.P. Sub Division Number 10\. Block Number 5 (Elgin Bridge, North Bridge Road, Colombo Court, Coleman Street)” Accession No.: SP002822 and “Sub division, Block No. 5” Accession No.: SP002166). The 1955 map was originally drafted in 1937 (according to the NAS record) and contains updated pencil and red ink markings dating to 1955\. The 1958 map was similarly produced based on the same 1937 map with new updates marked in pencil and red ink based on information gathered in 1958\. The shophouse buildings at the site remained similar in configuration in the 1979 survey map (see NAS Accession no.: SP005715) compared to the 1958 map. This 1979 survey map is based on a map originally drawn in 1953 and contained updates up to 1979\. Interestingly, another survey map dating to 27/07/1979 shows changes made to the layout and floor areas of the buildings (see NAS Accession no.: SP004321). According to the record, the plan is based on an original survey map made in 1972 and contains updated information up to 1979\. It would appear that by 1972, the configuration of the buildings parallel to North Bridge Road had changed. The foundations noted during the excavation would have come from these buildings shown in this survey map.
