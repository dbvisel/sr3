## Artefacts: Ceramics (14th century-1600)
The ceramic assemblage at PHC weighed 306 kg. It contained the largest proportion of local earthenware (by weight) of all sites in Singapore: 33.8%. Conversely, PHC yielded the lowest proportion of porcelain (11.4%). The percentage of stoneware, 54.8%, was lower than any other site except Fort Canning. 


Comparative percentages by site and weight (as of 2013, see Miksic 2013):


| Site | Earthenware (%) | Porcelain (%) | Stoneware (%) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| PHC      | 33.8            | 11.4          | 54.8          |
| OPH      | 11.4            | 14.4          | 74.2          |
| SCC      | 25              | 15            | 60            |
| EMP      | 8.4             | 13.3          | 78.3          |
| FTC      | 32              | 26            | 42            |
| STA      | 14.03           | 15.47         | 70.5          |

### Earthenware (14th century-1600)
Pottery made in Singapore normally contains sand as temper. They were made with the paddle and anvil method. There are some sherds without temper, possibly made with a slow wheel. Some were probably imported from south Thailand; these are normally creamy white in colour. Most of them were kendis, spouted water vessels used in ceremonies. Others with red to pink colour were probably made in east Java. Some were figurines.	 
This material comprised 103.625 kg (33.8% of all ceramics at PHC). This can be divided into two categories. 
- **Fine Paste Ware** (i.e. clay without any coarse material, neither natural inclusions nor particles added intentionally as temper) weighed 9.625 kg, almost 10% of the total of earthenware; 
- **Coarse earthenware** weighed 94 kg.
  
It is probable that Fine Paste Ware was not made locally, but in the Satingphra area of south Thailand, and in east Java, near Surabaya. Similar pottery has been found on board shipwrecks not far south of Singapore: the *Intan* of the tenth century (Miksic 2013:86-91; Flecker 2002), the *Cirebon,* the *Java Sea,* probably late 13th century Miksic 2013: 135-138; Mathers and Flecker); and the *Bakau Maranei*, early 15th century (Miksic 2013: 200-201). Large quantities were found at Kota Cina, northeast Sumatra (late 11th to late 13th centuries). Probably the examples found in Singapore and Kota Cina were made in southern Thailand and exported to Indonesia. 

Most Fine Paste Ware sherds were pieces of a type of water ewers called *kendi* in Malay (derived from Sanskrit *kundika,* also called *kamandalu*). This shape is often associated with religious rituals, but many similar ewers were found in other contexts (Miksic 2013: 358-359). Such ware is found at all Singapore sites, but PHC yielded a particularly large number of sherds of this material.

##### Nonlocal unique earthenware
Some sherds are so far unique; their place of production is unknown. They are of higher quality than most Southeast Asian earthenware: relatively high fired, with dense texture.

### Chinese Ceramics (14th-20th centuries) 
This category consists of porcelain weighing 35 kg (11.4% of ceramics at PHC) and stoneware weighing 167 kg (54.8%). This data can be interpreted in several ways. Porcelain would be more likely to be found in habitation areas than in industrial zones. The high proportion of local pottery in comparison with Chinese wares at PHC is consistent with the large quantity of metal objects there: both are likely to be associated with workshops rather than residences or ceremonial districts. This is not to say that the site of PHC was poor in the variety or value of ceramics found at the site; PHC yielded examples of high-quality Chinese ware, although not as numerous as earthenware.

#### Chinese Porcelain (14th\-century)

##### Iron-Spotted *Qingbai*
One of the star pieces from PHC is a specimen of iron-spotted qingbai ware in the form of a fragment of small dish (brush washer?) with boys playing in a lotus pond (found in square T2). This is the only specimen of this unusual type of object found in Singapore until now.

/> 

<Figure

Other iron-spotted *qingbai* items include a tiny round lid for a bottle (not found in context),

/> 
<Figure
img="Figure-55-DSC05277.jpg"
caption="Figures 55 Another iron-spotted *qingbai* lid"
/> 

Other examples include a lid for a small bottle and a rim of a small bottle with loop (no context).

##### Underglaze Copper Red*
This is another type of rare decorative porcelain made during the Yuan Dynasty. Only small items were made from this material. Examples include the body sherd (see Figure 56). The sherds are mainly small jarlets made in two parts; some were ewers with spouts.

<Figure
img="Figure-56-DSC04393-PHC-VI-1.jpg"
caption="Figure 56 Example of a copper-red porcelain sherd from PHC."
/> 


##### White Glazed Ware
The PHC assemblage included a large range of good to excellent quality white ware. White-glazed items perhaps made at Dehua or Jingdezhen include the head and torso of a young boy (Miksic 2013: 6.08). 

<Figure
img="Figure-57-6.08-PHC-head.jpg"
caption="Figure 57 White porcelain head"
/> 


<Figure
img="Figure-58-6.08-PHC-torso.jpg"
caption="Figure 58 White porcelain torso of a figurine."
/> 


Another white-glazed object is the base of a stem-cup for drinking wine (DSC01296). It is tempting but probably wrong to imagine the copper-smiths imbibing wine from porcelain stem-cups at the end of a hard day at the forge. Another small cup has a stamp with five characters (see Miksic 2013: 6.08).

<Figure
img="Figure-59-stem-cup-base-DSC01296.jpg"
caption="Figure 59 base of a white porcelain stem cup."
/> 


Other delicate white wares more closely associated with feminine than masculine taste include a *qingbai* lid for a small round container for such substances as cosmetics (Figure 60\) and a very finely-made lid for a larger covered box, probably made at Dehua (Figure 61 showing sherd recovered from Square 3 Spits 1-2). Among the enigmatic sherds which normally appear at any site from the premodern period in Singapore is a flat sherd of an unknown object with a brownish-white glaze and raised decoration consisting of thin squiggly lines (excavated from PHC 5/4, see Figure 62).

##### Green Porcelain*
Most examples of this material found at PHC were made in the 14th century in Fujian or Zhejiang. There are some special pieces of this ware, but most were common bowls.

Special pieces include:

/> 

##### White Ware Decorated with Underglaze Cobalt Blue Designs (blue and white porcelain)

	A few pieces of this type of ware were made in the Tang Dynasty, but this style only caught on in the export market starting around 1325\. Examples with underglaze blue decoration were relatively rare at PHC. Nevertheless, several unusually elaborate shapes were discovered there.

##### Porcelain *“gacuk”*

This Indonesian word denotes sherds of Chinese porcelain, stoneware, and locally produced earthenware sherds which have been intentionally chipped to create discs. Similar items have been found at the contemporary site of Trowulan in Java. Their function(s) is (are) unknown. They may have been used as a low-level medium of exchange, or possibly as game pieces.

#### Ming Porcelain (15th Century)
Singapore was an important part of the Melakan thalassocracy. It appears in the *Malay Annals* (Raffles MS 18 recension) as the home of the greatest Malay hero, Hang Tuah (who was transformed into a Bugis noble from South Sulawesi in the later Shellabear recension). Portuguese sources also refer to a great warrior without giving his name. After the fall of Melaka, he returned to his home in Singapore (Miksic 2013: 146, 153, 160, 196). 
Sites with early Ming porcelain are rare. Roxana Brown referred to the Ming Gap as a period beginning in 1368 when Chinese ceramics become rare, both on land and in sites underwater. This scarcity reached its maximum in the mid to late 15th century. Thereafter the supply of porcelain began to increase, but only returned to its former level after 1567, when the Ming ban on foreign trade was lifted. (Miksic 2013: 198, 208, 400). Singapore is one of the rare places where 15th\-century porcelain has been found in relatively large quantity. It is difficult to distinguish early Ming white porcelain from late Yuan examples, but at PHC, one of the more interesting examples of 15th\-century Chinese porcelain is a small white cup with a Chinese stamp on the base (Miksic 2013: 6.08). 
Early Ming blue and white ware on the other hand is easier to date. Examples of this ware at PHC are numerous (although no statistics are yet available). Most of the examples identified at this time are small bowls. Two unique sherds, a base and a body sherd, form part of a large bowl. The material and designs are significantly inferior to the other Ming sherds from PHC. This vessel clearly comes from another kiln site, probably located in Fujian.

One very fine sherd once formed part of a small bottle. Its decoration combines underglaze iron spots with overglaze enamel. Some fragments of yellow enamel still remain; others have left “ghosts” behind which were probably green, suggesting leaves and vines.

#### Chinese Stoneware (14th century-1600)
Usually comprising storage jars and other utilitarian vessels, they mainly consist of two types: buff and brittle ware. Buff ware is mainly associated with Guangdong, whereas brittle ware is known from Fujian. 
Buff ware was mainly used for utilitarian objects such as jars and basins. Glazes were mainly light brown to green. Lugs for tying lids to jars were modelled to resemble dragons. One example (Figure 78\) also bore incised decoration. Chinese characters were sometimes stamped between the lugs; these may have been meant to identify specific shops. Sometimes the potters carved a design through the glaze to create a contrasting pattern.

/> 

<Figure
img="Figure-79-DSC00975-spit-0.jpg"
caption="Figure 79 Buff stoneware sherd with lug and stamped character."
/> 

Brittle ware jars are less common. Brittle ware bottles however are quite numerous. They were probably designed to contain mercury (Treloar 1974). Numerous examples have been found in Singapore, including a cache of a dozen unbroken examples at OPH (Miksic 2013: 315-318; “mercury jars” from OPH). Mercury is a volatile metal and is rarely preserved in archaeological sites, so proof that these bottles functioned as containers for mercury is inferred from their form. They are plain but sturdy vessels and were reused for many purposes. One example found at PHC (Figure 80; from PHC IV/4) still contains calcium. It was probably obtained from grinding shells of molluscs. This practice is still practised today in the Straits of Melaka, where the lime thus produced is mixed with other condiments as part of the popular pastime of betel chewing (the name is taken from the leaf which is used as a wrapper).

<Figure

caption="Figure 80 Base of mercury jar."
/> 

One sherd of a jar has *sgraffiato* decoration created by carving a linear design through the brown glaze, revealing the light buff clay beneath it.

### Thai Stoneware (15th\-16th century)
This sherd is part of the lower half of a covered box. It was made in Sawankhalok in the 15th century (see Figure 82, sherd from PHC Sq 2 Spit 1).

<Figure
img="Figure-82-DSC05213-Sukhothai-II-1.jpg"
caption="Figure 82 Sukhothai ware from PHC Sq 2 Spit 1."
/> 


### Vietnamese Glazed Ware (15th\-16th century)
During the 15th century, when very few Chinese ceramics were exported, kilns in north Vietnam produced good quality ware decorated with cobalt blue. This ware was exported to many parts of Southeast Asia.

## Artefacts: Ceramics (19th\-20th century)
### Chinese Ceramics (19th\-20th century) 
#### Chinese Porcelain* 
	Examples of 19th\-20th century Chinese porcelain comprises Qing dynasty wares, such as blue and white, enamelware, and polychrome ware etc:

The other has no inscription, but has milling marks along the rim of the bowl. Another artefact consists of the neck and rim of a bottle, probably for ginger beer. It has a creamy white body covered by a light brown glaze. A section of copper wire wound around the neck was used to keep a cork in place.
