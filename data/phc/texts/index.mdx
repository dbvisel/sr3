### Abstract 
Archaeological research was conducted at the corner of High Street and North Bridge Road from November 1994 to January 1995\. During this excavation over 30,000 items were discovered. The finds provide evidence of several distinct phases of history on this site. About 50 centimetres beneath the present ground level, the excavation revealed foundations of shophouses built in the late 19th and early 20th century. Beneath and around these floors were remnants of 19th-century colonial life. At a depth of about 1 to 1.5 metres lay a layer of fine sand stained a rich black by a dense concentration of ash mixed into it. 
This black sandy layer contained many artefacts discarded during the precolonial settlement of Temasek, which flourished between 1300 and 1600 CE. The items found in this layer provide evidence of ancient Singapore’s trade with China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, and other parts of the Malay world, and remnants of local industries, specifically copper, bronze, and iron working. Some probable products of these workshops were also discovered: wire and fishhooks. Beneath the black layer, the sand turned white, and the groundwater level was reached with no further sign of occupation.

The Parliament House Complex (PHC) was the first large-scale archaeological excavation in the main settlement area of ancient Singapore. The PHC project demonstrated that archaeological remains from the Temasek period were not confined to Fort Canning Hill. The PHC research proved that remains from the precolonial past could also be found in other parts of the island.


### Prelude to Archaeology in Singapore: Fort Canning Hill
In 1821, John Crawfurd, a British officer serving under Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the Lieutenant Governor of the British colony of Bencoolen, southwest Sumatra, landed in Singapore in the course of a diplomatic mission to Siam and Cochin China (modern south Vietnam). During his layover, he devoted a day to walking around the boundary of what he stated was the ancient city of Singapore. The site was bounded by three natural features (the sea on the southeast, the Singapore River on the southwest, and the Forbidden Hill on the northwest), and one remnant of ancient Singapore: the Old Malay Wall on the northeast. The Old Malay Wall was an earthen embankment 16 feet (about 5 metres) wide and 9 feet (2.75 metres) high. It ran parallel to the Freshwater Stream, which formed a natural moat. No doubt the original wall had been taller. It may have been built in the early 14th century; Wang Dayuan, a Chinese traveller who visited Singapore twice in the 1330s, mentioned that the settlement had gates which could be closed in case of attack. 
Crawfurd’s report was more or less forgotten. Singapore’s history was deemed to have started with Raffles’ visit, despite the fact that Raffles himself said that he was motivated to explore Singapore by the Malay account of ancient Singapore’s five kings: the *Sejarah Melayu*. 	 
In 1983 a plan was mooted to redevelop Fort Canning Hill. Historian Kwa Chong Guan, later director of the Singapore National Museum, learned of this plan and organised institutional and private support to sponsor a project directed by Professor John Norman Miksic (who was then based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia) to see whether any evidence of pre-colonial activity could be salvaged before development began. Archaeological research in Singapore began in January 1984 with a 10-day trial excavation in Fort Canning Park, funded by Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum, with participation by several curators from the National Museum including Constance Sheares and Marianne Teo. The results demonstrated that abundant ancient pottery and coins on the hill could still be verified over 150 years after Crawfurd’s original description of them. 
For the next 10 years, Fort Canning remained the only area where archaeology was conducted in Singapore. Excavations on Fort Canning Hill provide insights into the activities conducted there during the 14th century. We now know that Fort Canning Hill (*Bukit Larangan*, the “Forbidden Hill” as it was known in Malay in 1819\) was the site of an extensive royal and religious complex. Excavations on the hill as of 2023 have focused on the area north of the Keramat Iskandar Shah. This research has revealed evidence of a group of royal workshops where glass and gold artefacts were made in the 14th century. Fragments of Chinese ceramics and glass beads indicate that the inhabitants of the hill had access to imported items of the highest quality. Chinese coins suggest that the inhabitants had a sophisticated economic system, but what role the coins played in the lives of the denizens of the palace quarter is unknown. Archaeological research on Fort Canning Hill is summarised in Miksic (2013).
