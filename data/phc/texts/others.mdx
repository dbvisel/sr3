## Artefacts
### Others
#### Glass
##### Precolonial period Glass**
Very little glass from this period was found. Only one shard can be termed an important find \[(Borrell\] Seidel 2000b, 2010: 141-156); Miksic 2013: 47, photo 8.08\]. This is a base of a jar made of opaque glass made by the core-forming method. Fragments of three other vessels with similar construction were found on Fort Canning, as well as one bead. Two intact vessels of this type are reported from the Philippines (Mindoro; Butuan). The forming technique is known from the Near East and Egypt, but the glass is chemically Chinese, as are the shapes of the vessels. Borrell (2010: 154-155) suggests they were made in Quanzhou, a port with strong contacts to Egypt and the Near East.

##### Colonial era Glass**
	Few examples of this material were found, and what was recovered are unexceptional. They include 19th\-century European bottes and a small glass goblet.

#### Stone
One enigmatic object was found in the undisturbed black layer, so it can be dated to the 14th\-16th century. It is a piece of soft sedimentary rock worked into a square, with a flat bottom and a mis-shapen upper surface. 
Another artefact consisted of a piece of rock crystal, worked into a regular pyramidal shape. Its function is unclear.

#### Faunal Remains 
These have been catalogued by Barbara Lewis in a separate report, which contains three appendices: tables of Mollusca according to habitat (Mollusca are characteristic fauna represented in the black sand stratum at PHC), NISP (number of identified specimens), and MNI (minimum number of individuals). The report also contains tables of NISP, MNI, and percentage of MNI within excavation units; and an provisional inventory of molluscan species recovered at PHC, including an addendum of August 2023 which provides new nomenclature which has been adopted since the original report was compiled. Other tables present the distribution of molluscan faunal groups by environmental niche, square, and spit; non-molluscan fauna by class: number of identified specimens (NISP) and percentage of the total. Non-molluscan fauna are listed by class, family, genus/species, and common name; Mollusca and coral are tallied by Square, Bag, and Spit (artificial stratigraphic unit). Other statistics include the Number of Identified Species Present (NISP), and Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) and the distribution of non-Molluscan fauna by spit and by square.

One special find consists of the shell of a tortoise, found in PHC II (8).  This material was highly sought after in ancient China, where it was used for such items as combs (Miksic 2013: 286). Tortoise shell was so important as a status symbol that the import of it was an imperial monopoly. It is possible that tortoises laid their eggs along the sandy east coast of Singapore; alternatively, the inhabitants of the Riau Archipelago and the east coast of the Malay Peninsula may have brought this commodity to Singapore, where it entered the international market.
