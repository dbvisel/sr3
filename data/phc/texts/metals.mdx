## Artefacts: Metal (14th century-1600)
PHC yielded a rich trove of artefacts, many of which have not yet been found on any other site either in Singapore or elsewhere. Many of these artefacts are made of metal, a significant proportion of which may have been made on the site. As Shah Alam (1997) notes, most studies of premodern metal-working in Southeast Asia focus on prehistoric sites; little research has been devoted to early historic period metal-working. Shah Alam’s MA thesis is one of the few technical studies on this subject. 

Metal artefacts found at PHC included gold, bronze, and iron objects. The following section summarises the results of Shah Alam’s research on the PHC metal objects (Shah Alam 1997).

### Gold
The gold found at PHC consisted of three flakes, the largest of which measured 10x5 mm. with a thickness of less than 1 mm. They were found in three dispersed locations (Sq II/5; Sq X/2; and T2/5. Their miniscule dimensions suggest that they were lost during goldsmithing activity.

### Iron: Cast and Forged
Iron was listed in Chinese sources as a common export in the 13th and 14th centuries (Hirth and Rockhill 1911, Rockhill 1914, Wheatley 1959). Numerous shipwrecks of the late Song and early Yuan dynasties contain iron artefacts along with Chinese ceramics (Miksic 2013: 325-329). At Santubong, Sarawak, northwest Borneo, a large complex of iron-working activity has been identified. At this site, which dates from the 12th\-13th centuries, a huge quantity of iron slag has been found. Sources of iron were located nearby, and the ore was smelted at Santubong, perhaps because mangrove wood was available there as fuel. No remains of tools or forges have been found at PHC, so either the iron-working conducted there was a small-scale artisanal enterprise, or the iron was transported elsewhere, including possibly to China, to be processed into tools or weapons. 

Byproducts of metal-working were present in significant quantity at PHC. A total of 1,565 objects (weighing 799 grams) were classified as iron slag. One excavation unit, Square X, accounted for the bulk of these (802 pieces, 392.5 g). Square VII also contained a significant amount (365 pieces, 181.75 g). Shah Alam distinguished 7 types of iron slag. Some of these items could be smithing slag; others could be hammer scales and hammer slag. 
Finished iron items include 33 fragments of an iron bowl or pot made of cast iron and therefore imported from China. Four fragments of iron knife blades of uncertain manufacture were also recovered: three from the same context (SQ XI level 1), and one from Sq 13 level 4\. Another iron fragment also from Sq XI level 1 consisted of a square, flat piece of iron measuring 86x69x9 mm (Fig 15 in Shah Alam 1997: 20 and Figure 15). This is one of 11 pieces of iron of similar shape and thickness found at the site. As Shah Alam notes, this may have been a billet, a standardised object which was meant to be traded and worked further by the purchaser into the desired finished product. In the 19th century, bar iron was the most common form in which raw iron was traded (Moor, *Notices of the Indian Archipelago and Adjacent Countries,* cited in Christie 1998: 8). Other iron objects included 23 pieces of iron rods and 156 other iron artefacts, but these were too corroded to identify their original shapes. 

Fishhooks were the most common metal items which could be identified as finished artifacts (11 bronze, 11 iron, and 353 fragments of iron fishhook shafts). Microscopic study indicated that annealing and drawing were used to make both copper/bronze and iron fishhooks. 

The conclusion of Shah Alam’s study is that PHC iron included cast iron imported from China, and forged iron, probably consisting of a combination of locally-worked metal and imports from Southeast Asia. 

### Copper/Bronze
Shah Alam also explored evidence of copper working at PHC. This consisted of spherical pieces of pure copper called prills. They are created during the process of extracting copper from its ore. This indicates that copper ore was being imported to Singapore and purified there. Some of the slag could be byproducts of copper smelting. 

In addition to the bronze fishhooks mentioned above, two hundred thirty-three fragments of copper wire were found, most less than 1 mm in diameter. Many were twisted or looped in various ways, some quite intricately. They may have been used as leaders for hooks and lines. (Illustrations: Shah Alam table 6, fig. 26a, b, c, d) 

Thirty-three fragments of identifiable bronze objects were also recovered. These included curved pieces of bronze vessels, possibly small cups. One fragment is flat, which Shah Alam interprets as possibly indicating a square container. Other flat pieces may possibly have been derived from bronze trays or even betel boxes. Some samples are of considerable hardness which suggests that they may have been cast. 

Another bronze fragment found in T2, level 4, is a spherical pellet bell 28 mm in diameter made to resemble a human face, possibly meant to be worn around the neck. A hollow conical object 31 mm long tapers from 24 mm to 13 mm in diameter (Shah Alam fig 21). This item, found in Sq II level 4 appears to have been cast. Shah Alam considered the possibilities that it was a kendi spout, or part of a sculpture. 

A unique decorative item consists of a flower with six petals and a stalk. Part was found in Sq I level 5; the other piece was found in Sq 4 level 2\. It seems to have been meant to be mounted on some other object as a decoration. 

One of the most unusual metal items found was a Chinese brass padlock. A similar artefact was found on the Rang Kwien shipwreck which sank in the Gulf of Thailand around 1400 (Prishanchit 1996: 295). Another was found on the Sinan ship which sank off Korea in the early 14th century (Anonymous 1984: II, plate 483). These padlocks consist of two parts which require a key to separate them. Similar padlocks were still being made in China in the 1970s. The padlock found in Singapore is decorated with an incised floral motif. This is the type of object one would expect to find in a commercial district where coins or other small, valuable objects would be stored.

### Coins or Coin-like Objects
These numbered 145\. Twenty are too corroded to be identified. The assemblage included one Sri Lankan coin, one possible Malay coin, and 123 Chinese coins.

#### Sri Lanka Coin
One coin unearthed in PHC II spit 5, an undisturbed context, was made in Sri Lanka between 1273 and 1302 (reign of King Bhuvanika Bahu). A similar coin was found at St. Andrew’s Cathedral in an excavation in 2003 (Miksic 2013: 263). Commerce between Sri Lanka and the ports on both sides of the Straits of Melaka was well-established at this period, but few archaeological remains of this trade have been reported (Miksic 2013: 362).

#### Possible Malay Coins
A possible Malay coin found in Sq III level 4 is 15 mm in diameter. This object is made of a tin alloy. A possible inscription in devolved Malay script appears on the obverse; the reverse is plain. The coin was cut into an approximate square, then struck with a die. This method of coin-making is attested for 15th\-century Melaka and 16th\-century Johor (Shah Alam 1996: Fig 28c; Dakers 1939). 

#### Chinese Coins
A total of 123 Chinese coins was unearthed at PHC. Of this total, 25 were too poorly preserved to be identified. Of the 98 legible coins, almost all (90 coins) were made during the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). Two were made during the Tang period (618-906 CE); the remaining six coins date from the Southern Song. The most recent coin (bearing the characters *Jia Ting Tung* Bao) was made in 1208\. (Fan, unpublished report; Borell 2000a. On ancient coins in Singapore, see Borell 2000b.) 

This distribution of dates is typical of other precolonial sites in Singapore. The early dates of some coins cannot be used as evidence that Chinese coins were used in Singapore in the Tang or Song periods. The main period when coins were exported was the northern Song; the peak of production was 1073-74, when 3 million coins a year were produced, but they remained in circulation for centuries thereafter. 

Coins were found in 16 of the 18 units excavated at PHC. The largest number (18) was found in the top 10 cm of SQ 10 (data from table, Borell 2000a). 

Twenty-one Chinese coins were found in unstratified contexts. Ten coins were found in SQ1, 30-40 cm depth; 6 more coins were found in the same square between 40 and 50 cm depth. This is the only apparent concentration of coins in the site. Coins were distributed fairly evenly within the site and at all levels. This indicates that they were being used in small-scale transactions on the site, rather than being hoarded.

## Artefacts: Metal (19th\-20th century)

### Coins
These are dealt with in two specialised reports (B. Borell 2000a and Fan n.d.) Some examples from the colonial period are not in these two sources; they were submitted to an outside specialist for cleaning and were not available to those authors. 
Layer 4 of T2. This coin, dated 1875, bears the profile of Queen Victoria, and was issued by the Straits Settlements. It is clearly intrusive.
