# Earthenware (probably Chinese)

Lead has been used as a flux in the Near East, where this technology may have first been employed; Myanmar; Java during the Majapahit period; Vietnam; and China. This technique enables potters to impart a glaze to earthenware bodies. The SCC site yielded lead-glazed earthenware probably made in China. This pottery contains coarse temper, creating a brittle body similar to that of stoneware. Some sherds have a white slip beneath the green glaze.

# Stoneware

Chinese stoneware in Singapore is normally divided into four main types: purple ware; tempered or brittle; buff; and mercury ware. The mercury ware category is actually a sub-category of tempered brittle ware, but because it is so ubiquitous, it has been classified separately. It is believed that most of the stoneware found in Singapore was made in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, but not enough research has been conducted on the mineralogy of Chinese stoneware of the Song to Ming period which would enable us to verify this hypothesis, or to link specific artifacts to specific kiln complexes in China.

## Mercury ware

or small-mouthed bottles were used to contain various commodities; some have been found at sites in Singapore with lime still inside them. The original use for which they were designed is almost certainly to contain mercury. They were so common and cheap that in Singapore they were sometimes discarded while still intact. A dozen intact mercury jars were found at OPH. They were probably made at one or more kiln complexes in the Quanzhou area, including Cizao. They were fired to a relatively high temperature; their fractures are quite sharp-edged. In the Song-dynasty site of Kota Cina, their mouths and mouth area were decorated with chocolate brown glaze, but in Temasek-period Singapore their mouths are almost always unglazed. At Fort Canning, out of 147 rims of this ware excavated, only 16 are glazed (Wong 2016: 11). Their bases are quite thick and narrow; their bodies become thinner as they proceed upward. The top area around the mouth is quite thin, and often the clay slumped downward. This was obviously of no concern to the potters; these were purely functional, not decorative vessels.Their interiors show quite clear grooves created during the potting process. Their light gray bodies contain large particles of a black mineral.

## Tempered or brittle ware:

This designation is used to refer to high-fired ware which resembles mercury ware in some ways. It is high fired, with sharp-edged fractures, and contains much coarse sandy temper. Most objects of this type are large flat-bottomed storage vessels. Some still bear traces of watery green glaze. They have lugs for tyeing down lids, usually made of wood. They have no other decoration. The bodies are usually light gray, though sometimes they exhibit a light brown or buff color. Another form of brittle ware has been called “grating bowls”. As the name implies, these are bowls with deeply incised lines in the interior forming a grid pattern. These have also been found at Kota Cina. Brittle tempered ware at SCC aside from the mercury bottles is relatively scarce compared to untempered buff ware. At Kota Cina, the proportions were approximately equal. At other sites in Singapore, brittle tempered ware is also less common than at SCC, but comprises a larger share than at SCC. The reason(s) for this are unknown. This difference may reflect different use of the SCC site; sampling error; or the chronology of the SCC site, which may have been used for a relatively shorter time than the other sites excavated in Singapore. Trading patterns may have fluctuated through the decades; the communication links with the areas of China where buff and brittle ware were made may have grown weaker or stronger at various times. It is thought that the buff ware was made in Guangdong; this assumption led archaeologists working on Chinese stoneware found in Sarawak to refer to this type as Kwangtung Ware (Zaini and Harrisson 1967; Wong 2011, 2016). It has since been asserted that this type of ware was also made at Jizhao in Fujian province.

## Buff Stoneware:

This ware contains little or no temper. The bodies of these vessels are much less dense and therefore lighter than the brittle ware. The color of the body is usually lighter. The exteriors are usually glazed, and the interiors often have a kind of purplish-brown wipe, the purpose of which is unknown. Most of these vessels are flat-bottomed storage jars, though basins (broad shallow vessels) are also found. The jars sometimes bear stamped decorations on the exterior, consisting either of dragons or Chinese characters. Another form of decoration consists of applique in the form of dragons. Fragments of this motif were found at SCC.

## Purple Stoneware:

This ware is rare but present at Kota Cina and several sites in Singapore. Only one sherd of this ware was found at SCC. It is the base of a jar. The exterior of the flat base which is 7 cm in diameter has spiral marks which suggest that it was cut from the potter’s wheel with a cord. The paste of the sherd contains fine white inclusions of chalky material. The lower part of the body is over 1 cm thick, but the material is not dense; it is approximately of the same consistency as buff ware. The bodies of these jars are cylindrical; the rims have a triangular flange around the mouths, which are approximately of the same diameters as the bases. An intact example of this ware was found at Tuban, the main port of the kingdom of Majapahit in the 14th century. Chinese archaeologists attribute this ware to Fujian.

# Porcelain

The porcelain from SCC can be assigned almost entirely to the Yuan period. It is difficult to be entirely certain of this conclusion, since green porcelain of the early Ming was almost identical to that of the Yuan. It is much easier to distinguish between blue-decorated white ware of the Yuan and that of the Ming, but very little blue and white ware of either type was found at SCC. This suggests that the SCC site was not used for a very long time. A total of 6,762 pieces of porcelain were recovered from SCC; their weight of 32.587 kg.is equivalent to 17.39% of all artifacts from SCC by number, and most coincidentally, 17.39% of all artifacts by weight!

The importance of porcelain in historical archaeology of Southeast Asia is disproportionately great. It can provide more precise dates for sites during the past millennium than other methods such as radiocarbon, since particular examples from China can be dated by their discovery in dated tombs, and sometimes by inscriptions or depictions in dated paintings. Porcelain was made in many forms, for many uses. It was produced at numerous industrial complexes in China, can theoretically be used to study links between sites in Southeast Asia and specific locations in China. Unfortunately, no precise methods have yet been devised to assign many porcelains to their kiln of origin. Some kilns were more famous in China than others, and inferior products can often be traced to specific localities. However, some secondary kilns became quite good at imitating the middle and lower ranges of production at the major kilns, so one cannot always be sure of the origin of any particular piece. In this project, we did not attempt to categorize porcelain by their placae of production. In future there may be new analytical methods which will make this degree of precision possible.

## Greenware

Various names have been developed by collectors to refer to types of porcelain, usually identified by colour. The term “celadon” has been used to refer to porcelain with a particularly attractive bluish-green colour. The best–known source of this ware was Longquan, an area in Zhejiang and northern Fujian. This categorization is however too imprecise for use in a typology such as is used here, and relies on too many unverified assumptions. In this report, the term “greenware” will be used to refer to porcelain in the many shades of green which have been found at SCC.

Green porcelain forms by far the largest proportion of porcelain at SCC: 5,407 pieces; weight 30.338 kg. 16.1% of all artifacts by weight; 12.34% of all artifacts by number. Greenware comprises 80% of all porcelain found at SCC. This ware assumes many forms and exhibits many decorative motifs. It would be possible to subdivide the greenware into categories by shape, decoration, size, and a wide range of other criteria. More human resources would be needed to do this than were available for this project.

The main forms of greenware are bowls. Other forms include large plates, small saucers, and squat jars with lids. (For an example of a sherd from a large squat lidded jar or _guan_, see Reg No. 00038, TP1 8, photos <a href="/scc/dataset/photographs/id/photographs_226">DSC03660</a>- <a href="/scc/dataset/photographs/id/photographs_46">65</a>).

A particular dark yellow coloured porcelain is sometimes called “golden celadon”. It seems likely that this colour was not often intentionally produced. Green porcelain is usually created by starving the kiln of oxygen, which leads to a process called reduction in which oxygen is sucked out of the glaze. If too much oxygen is present,the glaze sometimes turns yellow. Examples of this ware are rare but present at SCC (e.g. Reg No. 00049, TPI 8; photo <a href="/scc/dataset/photographs/id/photographs_212">DSC03608</a>; Reg No <a href="/scc/dataset/photographs/id/photographs_187">00057 TP1 7</a>; <a href="/scc/dataset/photographs/id/photographs_189">00057 TPa</a>; <a href="/scc/dataset/photographs/id/photographs_188">00057 TP1 7b</a>).

Methods of decoration include incising, stamping, applique, carving, and molding. Decorations at SCC are limited to a narrow range including floral designs and double fish (e.g. Reg No 00053, which is also a golden celadon bowl). Some examples have traces of slip under the glaze.Iron spots were sometimes used on green wares of the Yuan Dynasty; some have been found in Riau, and a sherd of a jarlet with iron spots was found on Fort Canning, but no sherds of this type of ware were found at SCC.

## Whiteware:

1,352 pieces; Weight: 2,249 grams.

Whitewares were made in many parts of China over a long period, before greenware became popular. White porcelain during the Yuan and Ming periods was reserved for more delicate objects. It was not used for large objects such as plates; it was used for some normal-sized bowls, but these were often decorated with finely molded décor. Whiteware was also used for such ceremonial objects as incense burners, and for luxury items such as pillows and figurines. Some white porcelain with a bluish tinge was highly esteemed; it was known as _qing bai_, “shadow blue/white”. White was also favoured for round covered boxes with lids.

It seems that white ware was made with two different materials. Some white objects are very thin, hard, with sharp fractures, bone white color sometimes called _blanc de chine_, and fine decoration. Other white objects are made of much softer material which was fired at a lower temperature, almost earthenware in texture, with buff bodies and creamy off-white or yellowish buff glaze. This type of material was mainly used for covered boxes and bowls with molded plantain leaf décor on the exteriors. The significance of this difference is not known; they may have been made a different sites. The best known white ware kilns during the Yuan period were located at Dehua in Fujian Province, and Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province. Dehua was known for its bone-white china; Jingdezhen was famous for its _qingbai_.

During the Yuan Dynasty, potters experimented with putting coloured designs on a white background. The most common was cobalt blue. This was the most popular and least expensive variety. It was only produced for the foreign market during the Yuan period. Other colours included black spots made with iron, and red designs produced with copper. The copper red was extremely difficult to control; few pieces of it were made, and the practice died out in the Ming Dynasty. No copper red was found at SCC. One sherd of iron spotted qingbai was found at SCC. Only two Yuan sherds with cobalt blue were found at SCC and only two Ming sherds with the same blue decoration were found there. Cobalt blue was more common at all other Singapore sites; this is one of the major differences between SCC and other Temasek period sites excavated. The significance of this difference is difficult to ascertain.
