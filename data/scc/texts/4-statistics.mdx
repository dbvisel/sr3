### EARTHENWARE (mainly locally made):

* 14,604 fragments; 28.216 kg.
* 18.9% of all artifacts by weight; 39.4% of all artifacts by number

_Distribution by Square_

| Square | Number of sherds | weight   |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------- |
| TP1    | 11,528 sherds    | 20,101 g |
| TP2    | 2,065 sherds     | 4,501 g  |
| TP3    | 2,011 sherds     | 3,614 g  |

### Non-local Earthenware:

**Fine Paste Ware**, untempered, mainly in the form of kendis (goblets, finely-made vessels with spouts for pouring water). Previous research has shown that these artifacts were probably made in the Pa-O area of southern Thailand.<span class="footnotecallout" footnote-data-id="1">1</span>

At least 1,072 sherds of this material weighing 1,311 grams were found at SCC. This is less than 1% of the earthenware from the site. No precise figures are available for other Singapore sites, so it is impossible at this stage to determine whether this figure is typical of the Temasek period as a whole. [For further statistics, see below.]

These figures do not include natural materials such as stone, bone, shell, etc., some of which have been worked by humans.

## Organic Materials

Small amounts, no more than a few grams, of bone fragments and charcoal were found in almost all spits of the three pits. No large concentrations were noted in any of them, however. The largest concentration consisted of 8 conch shells weighing 267 grams in TP3 level 7. One or two fragments which may be turtle carapace were also recovered.

# Statistics: 19th-20th CENTURIES

Modern/colonial period coins: 19

# Notes on the distribution of artifacts

The number of artifacts recovered is surprisingly large, but the proportions of the different types are within expectations based on research at other Temasek-period sites in Singapore, as is the total weight of the items. The proportion of Chinese to locally made ceramics (60%:40%) is within the estimated range of other sites in Singapore. Preliminary tabulation of data from other sites in Singapore indicates that wares made in China outweigh those made locally by a larger proportion (80%-20%).

The proportion of stoneware to other forms of ceramics at SCC is quite high. This may indicate that the Singapore Cricket Club site was mainly devoted to industrial activities, particularly metal-working. The Chinese porcelains found are of good quality, though one category,that of Jingdezhen white wares decorated with blue designs, is almost absent. This is a significant feature of the SCC site, the meaning of which is however unclear.

Given this high total and the small size of the majority of artifacts recovered, it would have been very expensive and time-consuming to register each artifact from the site. It was necessary to select items for registration based on each item’s potential to illuminate socio-cultural and economic matters. Thus small pieces of Chinese porcelain have been registered, whereas small pieces of stoneware and earthenware, beads of glass and stone and metal items, have not been registered. A total of 4,898 items have been numbered for eventual registration (2000 objects are registered as of March 1, 2018).
