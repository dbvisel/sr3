# Excavation Log and Images

## Breaking ground: April 7, 2010 (9 am–4 pm)

The team broke ground on April 7, 2010.  As described earlier, a backhoe was used to excavate the EW and NS trenches. The stratigraphic profile of the EW trench was drawn and the PIs spent the rest of the day clearing loose dirt deposited on the downhill side of the NS trench.

## April 8, 2010 (2–6 pm)

The PIs and a graduate student volunteer (Sharon) laid out Squares I and II. They excavated the top soil (20th-century root layer) and began clearing the 19th-century layer of laterite, brick, roof tile, rocks, and clay.

## April 9, 2010 (9 am–6 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) began clearing the topsoil and 19th-century layers in the northeast corner of Square II whereas the student volunteers (Tse Siang, Sharon, Meifeng, and Guangcan) excavated the 19th-century layer in Square I.

By afternoon, they had exposed the 14th-century layer. A heavy late afternoon downpour flooded the NS trench. A dike and channel were created on the east side of Square II to divert the rainwater. Despite this measure, a white porcelain base and several stoneware sherds were eroded out by a temporary stream flowing across the site.

## April 10, 2010 (9:30 am–12:30 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) worked in Squares I and II (14th-century layer) and Tse Siang in Square III (a small area west of the EW trench).

## April 14, 2010 (9 am–5 pm)

The team members continued excavating Squares I and II.

<Figure caption="Figure 17. April 14, 2010" img="siteplan14april2010.png" />

## April 16, 2010 (9 am–5 pm)

The stratigraphic profile of the east face of Square I was drawn. PI Goh worked in the northwest and north sections of Square II. PI Miksic excavated Lot 4 (yellow soil) layer area between Squares I and II. Tse Siang excavated the southeast corner of Square I. Iron-spotted _Qingbai_ (two sherds) and a fragment of a turquoise glass bangle were recovered.

## April 17,2010 (9 am–3 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) and Tse Siang extended the excavation to Square IV by clearing the topsoil and 19th-century layers. Three volunteers (Martina, Amanda and Jean) excavated the small area west of the EW trench down to the mottle soil layer (yellow and brown) indicative of the transitional layer between Lot 3 (14th-century) and Lot 4 (yellow sterile). The stratigraphic profile of the east profile of Square II was completed. The team was informed by the NParks that they would be permitted to extend the excavation until the end of the month.

## April 19, 2010 (9 am–6 pm)

PI Goh excavated the yellow compact soil layer (Lot 4) in Square I and levelled the layer to the bottom of the NS trench. A cluster comprising largely earthenware sherds (mainly fine paste ware) was excavated from the west uphill side of the NS trench in Square I. Another heavy downpour occurred at 5pm, but no flooding was experienced, and the site experienced no major disturbance.

<Figure caption="Figure 20. April 19, 2010" img="siteplan19april2010.png" />

## April 21, 2010 (9 am–5:30 pm)

PI Goh levelled off the southwest part of Square II. Four volunteers worked in the southwest corner of Square I. Stoneware, earthenware and several porcelain sherds were excavated, mostly in Spit 1 of Lot 3.  PI Goh and Sharon excavated the northeast corner of Square II which yielded artifacts such as earthenware, mercury jar, buff and brittle stoneware, and white porcelain and green porcelain.

<Figure caption="Figure 21. April 21, 2010" img="siteplan21april2010.png" />

## April 23, 2010 (9 am–6 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) levelled Square II down to the level of the backhoe trench (NS trench) and excavated Lots 1 and 2 of Square IV.  A volunteer (Meifeng) continued excavating the southwest corner of Square I. Square III and IV were laid out.

<Figure caption="Figure 22. April 23, 2010" img="siteplan23april2010.png" />

## April 24, 2010 (9:30 am–6 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) excavated Lots 1 and 2 in Square III. Tse Siang worked on the west and east sides of the south side of Square I. Three volunteers worked in Square IV in the area bordering Square II and recovered large pieces of stoneware and a few green porcelain bases and earthenware. A dense layer of fine paste earthenware was found on the west side of Square I near the southwest corner. Another important find was an eavesboard tile that was excavated from the southwest corner of Square I. 

<Figure caption="Figure 23. April 24, 2010" img="siteplan24april2010.png" />

## April 26, 2010 (9:30 am–6 pm)

On a day characterized by a constant drizzle, three student volunteers (Guangcan, Theresa, and Faizah) continued excavating Square IV. The PIs (Goh and Miksic) continued to excavate the southwest corner of Square I and later cleared Lots 1 and 2 in Square III, using the soil to fill sandbags to be used to prevent flooding when there was a heavy downpour. By 3pm, Square I was levelled down to Lot 4. Square II was also levelled down to Lot 4. A dressed/shaped stone was recovered from Square IV (see detailed information on this artifact in the database). Stratigraphic profiles of the west profile of Square II and south profile of Square I were completed. Note: in Squares I and II, the boundary between Lots 3 and 4 was not sharp; there was a gradual transition between the two lots over several centimeters in which the soil was mottled (mixture of brown and yellow soil).

## April 27, 2010 (1–6 pm)

Earthenware rim cluster excavated in the boundary between Squares I and III.

## April 28, 2010 (9:30 am–5:30 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) excavated the northwest and north corner of Square II down to Lot 4. Two volunteers (Guangcan and Sharon) excavated the west side of Square IV. Tse Siang levelled the east side of Square I and then worked on the west side of Square II. The PIs (Goh and Miksic) continued to excavate the northwest side of Square IV. Square III, Spits 1 and 2 (Lot 3) were excavated, as was the southwest corner of Square III (Spit 1, Lot 3). 

Square II (NE corner): significant finds included stoneware, earthenware and white porcelain. Square IV (NW side): sparse finds, mainly stoneware. Note: Square II (NE) and Square IV: artifacts appearing not at the top of the 14th-century layer but 5 cm below the top of Lot 3.

Square III: significant finds included green porcelain with lotus patterns – incised (provincial Chinese kiln, not Longquan).

Square IV S and SW sections: excavation of Lot 3, Spit 1 revealed sherds of _kendi_ spouts (probably from the same spout).

Rain around 5 pm. The PIs (Goh and Miksic) moved to Square IV (SW corner) where Miksic found blue and white porcelain sherds. NParks extended the dig permit for two more days until May 5 (Wednesday).

## April 29, 2010 (9:30 am–6:30 pm)

Areas excavated were: 

Square IV (SW and W corners) Lot 3, Spit 1: many earthenware sherds. 

Square III, Lot 3, Spits 1 and 2: earthenware rim and storage jar. 

Square III, west section, Lot 3, Spits 1 and 2: neck of earthenware knob

Square IV, NE corner, Lot 3, Spit 1

Square II, NE corner, Lot 3, Spits 1 and 2

Features comprising a posthole and root/round hole in Square IV, Lot 3 were revealed and photographed. Heavy rain at 3:30pm flooded the site. A new drainage ditch was dug in an attempt to drain rainwater and prevent disturbance.

## April 30, 2010 (9:30 am–6 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) worked in Squares II and IV (north section), Lot 3, Spits 1 and 2. Tse Siang excavated the middle of the west section of Square III. The diggers were entertained by  rehearsal by Stereophonics at Fort Green for their upcoming concert.

<Figure caption="Figure 28. April 30, 2010" img="siteplan30april2010.png" />

## May 1, 2010 (9:30 am–6 pm)

The PIs (Goh and Miksic) excavated Square IV, Lot 3, Spits 1 and 2. Tse Siang excavated Square III, Lot 3, Spits 1 and 2, and Sharon excavated Square IV, south section, levelling off the area.

The area dug by PI Miksic revealed a dense deposit of artifacts (large pieces including blue and white Yuan porcelain and large sherds of a Guangdong large jar). PI Goh found a Yuan Chinese copper cash (large-sized coin), 4.8 cm in diameter in very fragile condition and  fragment of a white porcelain large bowl (degraded glaze, likely from a provincial kiln) about 10cm  the east of the coin. Tse Siang recovered two fragments of a green bangle in Square III.

## May 3, 2010 (9:30 am–6 pm)	

This was the last day of the excavation, so the team attempted to recover as many artifacts as possible from the site while levelling off the areas by spits.
