# Summary of the Site: Finds and Stratigraphy

The figure below summarizes some of the unique finds excavated. It also presents an interpretation of the function of the site: a hypothesized 14th-century footpath with depressions resembling ditches on either side of the path, contemporaneous with the workshop located at the Fort Canning Dig site approximately 20 meters to the west, as well as for accessing other sites on Bukit Larangan (Fort Canning Hill). This proposed function of the site is based on two sets of data: 1) the stratigraphic profiles (see Figures 10 and 12), and 2) the distribution of artifacts (see Figure 30) strewn on the two sides of a sterile zone interpreted as the footpath.
