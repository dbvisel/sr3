This series of archaeological site reports is intended to make technical data available for comparative study to all scholars who work on Southeast Asian archaeology.  Detailed site reports for Southeast Asia including stratigraphic drawings, site maps,  the quantities of specific types of artifacts, illustrations of the main types of artifacts discovered, and laboratory analyses of mineral composition, identification of organic materials, the ancient environment, etc. are difficult or impossible to obtained for Southeast Asia. The situation is somewhat better for prehistoric sites, but such information is almost completely lacking for archaeological sites formed during the historical period (the last 2,000 years). Without such information it is impossible to formulate detailed theories regarding the evolution of complex society in this region: the approximate date or period when particular developments appear in different parts of Southeast Asia, the stages in the evolution of such critical variables as settlement patterns, local and long-distance trade, local and regional art styles, metal working, boat construction, architecture, and the roles played by the environment and cross-cultural contact in determining the timing, sequence, and nature of such developments.

This is a report of an archaeological survey conducted in 2005.
