The total weight of ancient ceramics (probably all from the 8th-9th centuries) was 4481 g. The total number of sherds was 643. Of this quantity, Chinese sherds numbered 136 (21%) and weighed 1485 g (33%). Local earthenware constituted 507 sherds (79%) or 2996 g (67%).<FootnoteCallout id="1" />

One of the few Southeast Asian sites where Tang ceramics have been found and reported in detail is Prei Monti, 15 km east of Angkor, Cambodia (Pottier, Desbat, Dupoizat, and Bolle 2012). This site is believed to have been the location of a royal capital in the ninth century. In phase 2 of the site, imported (Chinese and Near Eastern) wares constituted 17% of the total ceramics recovered, in terms of number of sherds. The majority of the Chinese wares were white bowls with broad flat bi bases from Hebei and Henan, similar to bowls found on the Belitung shipwreck, and also at Siraf, a Persian port of the ninth century. About 8% of the imported sherds belonged to approximately 11 objects (bowls and kendis) made of stoneware from Changsha. Yue ware was rare in the Prei Monti excavation, only three pieces having been identified (Pottier et al: 302).  It is possible that this rarity signifies a date in the early ninth century, before large-scale export of Yue ware began (Pottier et al 2012: 304), but this situation may be due to a Khmer preference for white porcelain over green. Three-colour ware comprised another 5% of the imported sherds, or approximately 5 vessels. The other Chinese imported ceramics were large olive- green-glazed jars, bowls, and basins from Guangdong. Similar bowls have been found in central Java, including one which was used as a container for a ritual deposit in Candi Sewu (Dupoizat 2006).  One of the areas excavated at Prei Monti contained a particular concentration of sherds of this type of ware, suggesting that they were used for some specific purpose (Pottier et al  2012: 303).The Near Eastern wares were turquoise blue fritwares comprising 103 sherds (about 12% of all imported ceramics) which represent a minimum of 5 vessels.

<Footnote id="1">Four sherds of earthenware have been provisionally identified as “foreign”: TP1.2 spit 3 no 28 (with pyrite); TP1.3 spit 4 nos. 1 and 2: 3 sherds, total weight 7 g. Their precise origin is unknown.</Footnote>
