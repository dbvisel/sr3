The 2010 Dieng excavation demonstrated that when some of the oldest temples in Java were built, Chinese and Persian ceramics were used by some of the pilgrims who visited the site. Nobody in Java lived permanently at altitudes as high as Dieng when the first explorers visited the plateau. Only in the last century were food crops able to survive in the cold conditions at 2,000 meters imported to Java, thus enabling farmers to occupy the area. In the 8th and 9th centuries, the only people living on the plateau would have been worshippers who brought their supplies with them from the lowlands. The results of this excavation prove that the study of ceramics found at temple sites in Java can contribute to our understanding of how the sites were used. Perhaps more research aimed at collecting data from ceramics around temples will be conducted in the future.
