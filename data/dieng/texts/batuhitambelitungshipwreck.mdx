The largest quantity of Tang ceramics yet recovered from archaeological research in Indonesia has been found on the Belitung or Batuhitam shipwreck which sank in the sea lane from the South China Sea to the Java Sea in about AD 835.  On dry land, the largest amount of Tang ceramics in Indonesia has been found in the Palembang region of southeast Sumatra (Manguin).  No major deposits of this ware have been reported thus far from Java. No Changsha three-colored ware has been reported from excavations, but Changsha kendis were found by villagers during the construction of a well near Candi S, between Prambanan and the Ratu Boko Plateau. Three-colored Changsha ware is commonly found in the Malay Peninsula, in Kedah and southern Thailand, where it is associated with glass and turquoise fritware from the Near East. Dusunware jars have been discovered at several sites in the Prambanan area, include intact examples which were buried to contain valuable items.  Sherds of green-splashed ware, probably from Gongxian, Henan, were found on the surface of the courtyard of Candi Sari, near Prambanan, and in an excavation conducted by the Department of Archaeology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, on the Ratu Boko plateau in the early 1980s.  Few of these finds have been published.  It is hoped that the report of this brief excavation will encourage other archaeologists to publish more data about finds of Tang dynasty ceramics in Southeast Asia so that their distribution and quantity can be more clearly understood.  Only when a substantial body of information on this topic has been accumulated will it be possible to understand the significance of the Batuhitam/Belitung shipwreck.

## EARTHENWARE CERAMICS FROM DIENG

Most of the earthenware found on the plateau was probably made in the nearby lowlands. It is not possible to be more precise than this; the Javanese earthenware of this period has not been intensively studied. The use of pyrite as temper may be one guide to the probable production area of many of the sherds found at the Football Field.

The shapes which can be reconstructed are common in other central Javanese sites (Mundardjito, Ingrid H.E. Pojoh, and Wiwin Djuwita Ramelan 2003); these include: 

 * _kuali_ (frying pans), 
 * _kendi_, vessels for pouring drinking water,
 * _pengaron_ (stove), 
 * carinations (probably parts of cooking pots), 
 * jars, 
 * _gacuk_ (disc), 
 * _periuk_ (cooking pot), 
 * umbrella kendi (flanged neck water vessel), 
 * _cobek_ (mortar for grinding), 
 * _genuk_ (large spherical jar).

One interesting aspect of the earthenware assemblage from the Football Field sector is the relatively common use of carved-paddle impressing for decoration. This was never common in central Java, but was standard in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Examples of carved-paddle impressed sherds from the excavation include:

 * TP1.1 Spit 4 No10 (Photo 37, bottom right]
 * TP1.2 Spit 2 No 1

 * A’c 11.3 Spit 4 No 109 (Photo 76, DSCF3638)
 * Ae11.3 Spit 3 No 7 Photos 83-84

One streak-burnished rim sherd with a gray body was discovered (Ae11.3 Spit 5 No 11; Photos 85, 86). No fine burnished red ware was recovered, though such fine ware has been found elsewhere on the plateau (see Appendix 4). 

# CONCLUSION

The 2010 Dieng excavation demonstrated that when some of the oldest temples in Java were built, Chinese and Persian ceramics were used by some of the pilgrims who visited the site. Nobody in Java lived permanently at altitudes as high as Dieng when the first explorers visited the plateau. Only in the last century were food crops able to survive in the cold conditions at 2,000 meters imported to Java, thus enabling farmers to occupy the area. In the 8th and 9th centuries, the only people living on the plateau would have been worshippers who brought their supplies with them from the lowlands. The results of this excavation prove that the study of ceramics found at temple sites in Java can contribute to our understanding of how the sites were used. Perhaps more research aimed at collecting data from ceramics around temples will be conducted in the future.
