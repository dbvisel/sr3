Most of the earthenware found on the plateau was probably made in the nearby lowlands. It is not possible to be more precise than this; the Javanese earthenware of this period has not been intensively studied. The use of pyrite as temper may be one guide to the probable production area of many of the sherds found at the Football Field.

The shapes which can be reconstructed are common in other central Javanese sites (Mundardjito, Ingrid H.E. Pojoh, and Wiwin Djuwita Ramelan 2003); these include: 

 * _kuali_ (frying pans), 
 * _kendi_, vessels for pouring drinking water,
 * _pengaron_ (stove), 
 * carinations (probably parts of cooking pots), 
 * jars, 
 * _gacuk_ (disc), 
 * _periuk_ (cooking pot), 
 * umbrella kendi (flanged neck water vessel), 
 * _cobek_ (mortar for grinding), 
 * _genuk_ (large spherical jar).

One interesting aspect of the earthenware assemblage from the Football Field sector is the relatively common use of carved-paddle impressing for decoration. This was never common in central Java, but was standard in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Examples of carved-paddle impressed sherds from the excavation include:

One streak-burnished rim sherd with a gray body was discovered (Ae11.3 Spit 5 No 11; Photos 85, 86). No fine burnished red ware was recovered, though such fine ware has been found elsewhere on the plateau (see Appendix 4).
