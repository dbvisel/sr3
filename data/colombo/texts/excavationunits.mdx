Conditions were less than optimal for excavation. Excavation was often interrupted by weather and the need to avoid areas or leave the site where construction work was in progress. Ground water often rose to a depth of 1 meter below the surface. Main research took place in November and December 2000, the rainy season, so the pits often were inundated by rainwater, which also made maintenance of soil profiles difficult. The excavation had to be halted at the end of December 2000. Despite these drawbacks, the site produced enough evidence to conclude that this area had been inhabited in the Temasek period.

Colonial era artifacts recovered from the site are also useful for reconstructing the nature of the activities in the nineteenth century, before substantial structures such as shophouses were built on the site and roads were paved, halting the deposition of artifacts.
