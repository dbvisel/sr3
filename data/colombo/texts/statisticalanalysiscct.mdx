title: "Statistical Analysis of the Artifacts in the CCT Assemblage"

import Figure from "../../../src/components/figure";

The following section contains a series of pie charts and statistics compiled of the artifacts in the CCT assemblage by type of materials and wares. The treemaps show the proportion of the different types of artifacts in the CCT assemblage. The project team was able to compile a full database on the 14th-century-1600 porcelain sub-assemblage and 14th-century-1600 stoneware sub- assemblage, and a large sampling of the earthenware and colonial artifacts. The statistics presented here characterize a full sample of the entire CCT assemblage, excluding the construction debris (which were collected, but we will not be including them in the study and database). The data entry of all remaining earthenware and colonial artifacts will continue and future updates will be provided as and when they are ready. The goal of the project is to produce a database of 3,000 artifacts; and whilst the research and cataloguing will continue following the uploading of this report and database; updates will be uploaded periodically to the database. Further sections may also be added and these comprise specific detailed studies on individual types of ware.
