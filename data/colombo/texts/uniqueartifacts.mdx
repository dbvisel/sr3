import Figure from "../../../src/components/figure";

Overall the CCT assemblage comprises a mixture of 14th-century to 1600 ceramics (earthenware, stoneware and porcelain) and 19th–20th century ceramics as well as other accompanying artifacts, such as metal, glass, organic materials, stones and rocks, and construction materials (of which we do not include in the database). The disturbed nature of the soil layers has rendered the analysis of distribution of materials via spit and square units irrelevant and unuseful (explained in an earlier section). There are, however a number of interesting artifacts which should be featured in this report. This section of the report will showcase some of these more unique items (what we consider “Special Finds”). The items will be presented via provenance, material and time period.

## Coins

### Chinese Coins

- 14 from Northern Song, 1 from South Song.

_Shen Zhong_ 北宋神宗 (r. 1068-1085)

The density of Chinese coins is comparable to that observed at PHC, where over 100 were recovered in a larger area. This indicates that commerce was an important part of the activities on the CCT site in the Temasek period as well as in the 19th century.

### Colonial Coins

- Netherlands East India Company: 1
- Nederlandsch Indie: 51
- English East India Company: 1
- Queen Victoria: 1

The Nederlandsch Indie coins were all found in the same location (IIG2). The precise context of the find was not recorded, but it is likely that this is a hoard deposited here for safekeeping.
