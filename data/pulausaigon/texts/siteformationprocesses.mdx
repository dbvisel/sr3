Pulau Saigon is not a normal site where one could hope to find stratified deposits that could be interpreted as the result of gradual long-term formation processes such as habitation or artisanal activity. The main formative processes at Pulau Saigon were municipal rubbish disposal and animal slaughter. Unloading of cargo from bumboats may also have resulted in the haphazard disposal of damaged merchandise. Different types of soil appeared in different locations, probably the result of irregular dumping rather than natural soil formation. Barry (2000: 18-21) discusses the complications of interpreting the site. Some soil may have been brought here from other parts of Singapore.

Artifacts were densely distributed at the site but the northeastern quarter appeared to exhibit the greatest density. Most of the artifact assemblage was recovered from what was the main river channel after it had been drained rather than the island (Barry 2000: 18). Such a site formation model would suggest that deeper finds would be the oldest, but some recent artifacts such as 20th-century coins were found at depths between 2 and 3 meters. The original stratigraphy would have been turned upside down in 1889 when the river was dredged to raise the level of Pulau Saigon. Older items dumped in the river would have ended up on top of the newly elevated surface. There may have been a second period of dredging and filling when the new bridge was built in the 20th century. 

Concentrations of similar or identical artifacts took the form of thin horizontal lenses rather than heaps. This suggests that they were thrown into the water from baskets or other containers from the riverbank or from boats unloading wares to be stored in the godowns. Artifact deposits were found up to a depth of 3 meters in most areas where excavation reached this depth. In the bed of the river, where coffer dams had been set up to enable excavation, artifacts also were found up to three meters below the surface of the riverbed. These observations show that rubbish dumping was not confined to the island; trash was also disposed of in the river itself. Casual dumping of rubbish around the edges of the island declined after municipal trash collection and incineration were introduced in 1889 (Makepeace et al 1921: 325), but obviously did not cease entirely. 
	
In the eastern arm of the river facing Merchant Road, one of the present authors (Miksic) observed a concentration of almost intact European stoneware bottles. Southwest of Bridge 2 in front of the Central Building, conglomerations of black peaty and black sandy soil contained a wide variety of materials from shells to flint, slate, fish bone; incised earthenware, coconut shell; coarse glazed stoneware; and Kitchen Qing. This sector also yielded the only clear evidence of precolonial occupation on the island: sherds of several bowls made of 14th-century Yuan Dynasty celadon and one blue and white porcelain sherd.

It is important to note that 14th-century inhabitants who had access to Chinese porcelain lived this far up the Singapore River.  No evidence of ancient occupation has been found anywhere on the island this far from the coast.

## Artifact Types

Barry (2000: 22) analyzed ceramics weighing 262.8 kg from the site. The proportions according to general types were Chinese porcelain (63% of this total); Asian stonewares: 18%; European white earthenware: 7%; European stoneware: 7%; Asian earthenware: 3%; and miscellaneous, 2%. 

Mr. Koh (1989) listed six categories of artifacts: Chinese porcelain, Chinese stoneware, European ware, glass and pottery [earthenware], slate (rock), and coins. Coins were relatively rare; they included British coins dated 1872, 1873, and 1883, and a Sarawak coin dated 1883 (Koh 1989: 68-69). European sherds comprised fewer than 5% of the ceramics collected. These included such items as six intact European stoneware bottles (Koh 1989: 71, fig. 44), and clay tobacco pipes (Koh 1989: 72). One cluster of stoneware gin bottles was found a meter away from another cluster of glass liquor bottle sherds, with heavily devitrified light green necks and spiral glass strands (Fig 48). They are “dated no later than 1870)” (Koh 1989: 72). Other European artifacts included slates, probably used for roofing such as are common in England (Koh 1989: Fig 56). Similar objects were found in excavation at St. Andrew’s Cathedral, where the roof was originally made of this material.

A few sherds of earthenware were found, some of which may be premodern. Their rarity in the assemblage may be partly due to sampling bias since they are more difficult to see when they are covered mud, and are more fragile. Koh divided them into four groups (Koh 1989: 73). Some jarlet sherds were decorated with geometric patterns (Koh 1989: fig. 52), impressed squares (Koh 1989: fig 53), or “corded patterns” with traces of pyrite (Koh 1989: figs 54-55) (these were probably made by using carved paddles or jabbing with a pointed tool). Barry (2000: 35) recorded that earthenwares comprised 7.1 kg or 3% of sherds by weight. She discerned three types: coarse, fine paste, and semi-fine white bodied types. Coarse grown or gray-bodied sherds numbered 208; 16 are decorated with incised, stamped, pecked, paddle-impressed, and mat-impressed designs; four have traces of red paint. There were 12 pink fine paste sherds; 16 pinkish-white soft fine paste sherds. Seven sherds were classified as intermediate examples, six of which are paddle-impressed.

Some natural objects such as shells were also collected. Many exhibit holes drilled in them. Barry (“Report”, page 4) includes the information that “[Emily] Glover notes that holes evident in many examples were drilled by predatory molluscs rather than by man as proposed by Koh in his case for a prehistoric habitation of the site.” Other items once thought to be possible prehistoric items are now known to be bone toothbrushes.

Chinese porcelain was the most varied category by far. Koh (1989) identified 31 groups of Chinese porcelain: bowls with double-happiness characters; Straits or _Peranakan_ blue and white bowls with formalized scrolls and butterfly motifs; “batik bowls” (a term coined by William Willets 1981: 11). Chinese porcelain with red seal marks of the Tongzhi reign are other items datable to the 19th century. 

Barry (2000: 24) devised a classification system consisting of monochromes, underglaze blue, and “provincial blue and white ware”. 28:  Monochrome whitewares or overglaze polychromes cannot be assigned to production sites (Barry 2000: 24). The identifiable monochromes were subdivided into “Qing green”, dark blue, and coral-red. These are usually attributed to Jingdezhen, though Ho 1988:12) showed that Fujian also produced blue and green monochromes.  The underglaze was also made both at Jingdezhen and other kilns, some of which were popular among Chinese both in China and overseas, and some were made for European markets such as the willow and Fitzhugh patterns (Barry 2000: fig 8). An almost intact planter (fig 9) was probably made for the Japanese market.

Provincial blue and white ware comprised 54% of the Asian porcelain analyzed by Barry, or 45% of the entire ceramic assemblage. Ho (1988: 3) called it Min Yao; Willetts called it Kitchen Qing (Willetts 1981). Comparable examples have been found at other sites, of which examples have been published from Tioman (Lam et al 1985: 134; Yeo and Martin 1978: 286). Some patterns were made at one manufacturing centre at Fujian, but others were widespread. 

These provincial wares vary greatly in quality. Barry (2000: 26) distinguished three grades of quality (I, II, and III, plus intermediate types I/II, II/III). Some motifs such as Sweetpea Blossom and Foliage, Chrysanthemum and Flower Stalks, and Book, Bamboo, Prunus and Peony can be found in all three grades. Double Happiness and Scrolls, or Fungus of Immortality, Fruiting Peach and Spiral are only found in grades II and III. Handpainted Butterflies and Formalized Scrolls (Barry 2000: Figs 19, 20, 21) appear only in Grade I; blockprinted versions are found in both fine (Fig. 27) and coarse vessels (Fig. 29).

Grade III wares are closer to stoneware. Stacking rings and sand adhesions are common features on Grade III wares (fig 26). Block printing was almost always associated with Grade III wares. Exceptions include one Butterflies and Formalized Scrolls bowl of Grade II (Figure 27), European coat of arms, 27: Chrysanthemum and Devolved Conch Shell (Barry 2000: 27, Fig 27) and Sanskrit character for _om_ (fig 28). 

Block printing was sometimes combined with hand-painted décor. Block printed wares comprised 18% of the underglaze blue provincial wares. Grade II block printed examples weighed 4.34 kg, while those of Grade III weighed 10.33 kg. A few sherds of Batavia Ware (chocolate brown exteriors, underglaze blue on a white background) were found: a wash basin with sweet-pea blossom and foliage pattern, and a saucer with fish among waterweeds (fig 31). 

A few sherds of underglaze blue were combined with copper red fish (fig 32). In another variation, underglaze blue paintings are found under a watery green glaze (fig 33). According to Ho Wing Meng (1953: 126) these were made for Baba households.

Barry (2000: 29, fig 37) identified a few unusual sherds as belonging to the types called Nonya Ware (found mainly in sites in the Malaysia-Indonesia region) and Bencharong sherds (found mainly in Thailand) made at Jingdezhen (Lim Suan Poh 1981: 17, 19; Harrisson 1988: 70). Bencharong is usually dated a century earlier than Nonya ware, i.e. 1750-1850 (Harrisson 1988: 70-72). These two types together only weighed 580 g. It is possible that these sherds belong to other, as yet unrecognized, types. 

Barry (2000: 30; figs 38, 39, 40) also identified a few stencil-printed blue and white sherds sometimes combined with stamped or hand-painted designs as Hizen ware made in Japan. These weighed 1.89 kg. Other types such as underglaze blue printed wares (fig 41, 31 fig 42) are of uncertain origin. Other unidentified sherds include Fig 43, reminiscent of “egg and spinach; green glazed molded sherds (fig 44), and brown or black shiny glazed jarlets and bean pots. 

Chinese stonewares exhibited a wide range of shapes, including a spittoon-shaped vase, almost intact (Koh 1989: Fig. 36, p. 68). Koh divided Chinese stoneware into 8 groups, including several types of jars potentially used for containing wine, probably made in Fujian, and famous Yixing ware used for teapots. One has an eight-character poem engraved on the base; another has names of three persons impressed on the body (Koh 1989: Figs 39, 40). Barry (2000: 32) did not conduct detailed analysis of stoneware, but she did identify five groups. The first consists of fine brown-glazed ware, including opium pots, spoons, vases, covered boxes, jars, jarlets. 4.14 kg. (Fig 46). The second is “brittle ware” (Fig 47 top), which in texture more closely resemble buff than brittle stoneware with fine handles and thin bodies, examples of which were found in the cargo of the _Diana_, which sank in 1817 (Christie’s 1995: 60). These also include pots probably used for boiling herbs to make medicine, and cake stamps (Barry 2000: 33). Group three consists mainly of thick bodied clunky objects with streaky colours, and some raised clay dots, which were possibly once darker but are now mostly white with a little green, which are similar to some architectural objects, e.g. balusters. Group four (Barry 2000: 34) includes coarse brown-glazed ware, mainly fragments of large jars decorated with paddle marks, etc. She does not provide photographs of these. Group five (Barry 2000: Fig 45) comprises Yixing or Yixing-type ware, and an unusual plum colored urinal, possibly from Shiwan.

Barry (2000: 36) next dealt with European white earthenware of the type invented in Staffordshire. These are usually decorated with transfer-printed patterns or painted by hand or sponge in the Gaudy Dutch manner. These were made in several parts of Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. At Pulau Saigon, white earthenware comprises 52% of all European ware, which was 7% of the entire ceramic assemblage that she analyzed.

The transfer-printed subtype appears in numerous designs. Blue designs modelled on Chinese patterns were most popular, as was Wild Rose (fig 49), made from the 1820s to 1860s in various places including Regout in Maastricht and Robert Cochrane in Glasgow. The famous Blue Willow appeared in Staffordshire in the early 1800s, and was sold to Petrus Regout in 1855. It was also made in at least 10 factories in Scotland (Cruickshank 1987: 12). Blue is the most common colour at PSG (Barry 2000: 37, fig 49-50), followed by red (fig 51, 52), brown (fig 53), green (fig 53), mauve (fig 54), and black. A decorative technique called “Flow blue” is found on PSG examples made during the 1860s and 1870s. A similar type is also found, dated 1860s-1880s; (Barry 2000: fig 55).

A special type of transfer-printed ware was made for Southeast Asian markets, mainly in Scotland, but also in Belgium, England, France, Germany, and Netherlands. Many patterns had Asian names such as Johore, Kim Ki Soah, or Kwantung (fig 56). Cochrane made a pattern called Butterfly and Rose, which other British potteries called Singapore or Penang. J. & M.P. Bell in Glasgow registered 30 patterns for Southeast Asia with the Patent office between 1887 to 1906 (Cruikshank 1987: 24). Many were printed in two colours (e.g. the Johore pattern, fig 56). 

Barry (2000: 38) cites a personal communication from Graeme Cruikshank in which he identified some patterns as possibly designed for Straits-born (_peranakan_) Chinese, decorated with floral sprays on the rim and cavetto, while the central area is mainly plain (Barry 2000: fig 57). These were made by the Johnson Brothers of Staffordshire in the 1920s; similar types were made in Maastricht. After 1945 Japanese potteries imitated this pattern.

In Barry’s sample, transfer printed ware constituted 7.27 kg, of which 4.84 kg is blue, 0.4 kg is identified provisionally as _peranakan_, and only 0.22 kg is Scottish export ware with Asian designs.

Colourful hand-painted and sponge printed ceramics termed Gaudy Dutch were also made in Wales, England, Scotland, and Japan. It was made in Scotland, by 1855. Similar examples are found in Canada (Cruikshank 1982: 7). Some were found at the Spode site in Stoke-on-Trent. Barry (2000: 39, figs 58 and 59) illustrates hand-painted and sponge-printed examples.  These comprised: 4.17 kg in her sample.

<Figure img="Fig11GaudyDutch.jpg" caption="Fig. 11 Gaudy Dutch" />

European stoneware was more common in her sample, at least by weight (17.6 kg; Barry 2000: 40). All except for one olive green sherd could be assigned to one of three known types. British and German stoneware were almost exactly equal in number (37 and 39 sherds). One well-known type, Rhineland salt glazed ware, has been exported since the mid-15th century. All examples are mineral water bottles made in Nassau County (Barry 2000: fig 60). Some intact British bottles were recovered. Probably they were tossed into the river after their contents were imbibed. These consisted of English and Scottish brown salt glazed wares. A particularly European object recovered was a salt glazed blacking bottle (Barry 2000: 41, fig 62).

Clear-glazed stoneware developed in Bristol in 1835 eventually replaced salt glazing. Bottles of this ware were used to store ginger beer, preserves, rennet, ink, and polish (Cruikshank 1987: 13). Some were partially dipped in brown glaze, creating a contrast with the creamy white body (Barry 2000: fig 62). Scottish stoneware is generally paler than English.

The assemblage analyzed by Barry included relatively few artifacts from the period after World War II (Barry 2000: 42). Possibly this is due in part to the collecting procedure. She distinguished five main groups, some of which are Chinese, while others cannot be assigned to a specific provenance.
