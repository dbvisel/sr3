During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the increase in industrialization and urbanization drove the demand for Chinese porcelain and all things Chinese (Pierson 2007, 88). This phenomenon came to be known as ‘Chinamania’ (Blaszczyk 2002, 6), and it was accompanied with the rise of the new middle class and a new consumer-orientated economy in Europe (Armitage and Roberts 2017, 6). In the United States, this phenomenon also signified a change in women’s identities and consumption patterns as women entered the market as cultural consumers (Blaszczyk 2009, 61). Blue and White Chinese porcelain were among the most coveted items of the period. In order to satisfy the growing market, Europe developed unique thermal transfer printing method that resulted in a higher printing efficiency for porcelain designs (Hildyar 2009, 6). The invention of transferring prints to porcelain or pottery not only significantly reduced the cost of porcelain production but also reduced the amount of time spent hand painting the motif, which was a common technique used in China (Frelinghuysen 2013, 4). This resulted in the rising competition between European pottery manufacturers, such as Wedgwood and Spode, and the Chinese ceramics traditionally imported and sold exclusively by the East India Companies (Crook 2016, 308). One of the most distinctive Blue and White transfer printed designs created in Europe was the Blue Willow. 

The Blue Willow design remains one of the most popular Chinoiserie design today and is being produced globally, including China. The Blue Willow has come to represent something beyond a porcelain, it symbolizes China and the Chinese culture to many people in the West (O’Hara 1993, 421). Collectors today tend to reminisce about the Blue Willow legend that was told to them as a child (McClary 1982, 56). The Blue Willow has certain distinctive motifs that allow us to identify a porcelain as a Blue Willow. The motifs include a pair of doves, a Chinese boat, a bridge with three or four men, a willow tree, pagodas, a river, and a crooked fence. These motifs are extremely crucial to a Blue Willow ware as they are tied to the legend behind the plate. 

It is interesting to note that the original Blue Willow legend was not produced from China. It originated from the United Kingdom (O’Hara 1993, 421). Though the exact date and location vary among scholars, the general consensus on the date of original production falls sometime between 1760 to 1780 (O’Hara 1993, 421; Williams 1949, 129). It was believed that local engravers, such as Thomas Lucas and Thomas Minton, were inspired by Chinese materials and designs to produce Chinoiserie Chinese landscape design on European ceramics (Williams 1949, 129). The Chinoiserie wares they produced typically featured scenes such as pagodas and Chinese boats or junks. However, the design only took its final form in the 1780s under Spode ceramic company, founded by Josiah Spode (O’Hara 1993, 422). 

Ceramics is by far the most abundant category of artifacts recovered in nineteenth to twentieth century colonial Singapore sites. Unlike ceramics from earlier periods characterised by Chinese, local and regionally made wares, there is an increase in the variety of imported wares in the colonial period. This included ceramics imported from Europe and Japan. The European ceramic assemblage in colonial Singapore consists mostly of transfer printed porcelaneous wares (refer to PSGEP0216 or PSGEP0272). Other commonly used decorative techniques on European wares include sponge printed, hand painted, flow blue, and lustre painted. At PSG, the total transfer printed wares excavated is 512 (50.89% of the total number of European sherds). Among the Blue Willow ware excavated in PSG, the most common forms are shallow bowls with a slightly raised foot with the height of foot ranging from 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm (10.35% out of the total number of the transfer printed wares). Two of the sherds were found with manufacturer’s mark (maker’s mark) at the bottom of the base (refer to PSGEP0346 and PSGEP0347).
