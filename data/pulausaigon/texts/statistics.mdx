The statistics presented are gathered from 77.4 percent of the artifacts in the PSG collection (5,877 items out of a total of 7,592, the remainder of which have not been analyzed at the time of writing).

The following tree diagram shows the relative proportions of artifacts by type of material in this report and database:

The following two pie charts provide a summary of the percentages of the type of ware by number of sherds and by weight in grams. The greater proportions of Chinese ware (porcelain and stoneware) reflect the greater representation of these types of artifacts at the Pulau Saigon site, but one should take caution that as there was no excavation undertaken, the proportions may also demonstrate the collection bias.
