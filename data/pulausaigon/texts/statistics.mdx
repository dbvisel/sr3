The tree diagram shows the relative proportions of artifacts by type of material in this report and database:

The two pie charts provide a summary of the percentages of the type of ware by number of sherds and by weight in grams. The greater proportions of Chinese ware (porcelain and stoneware) reflect the greater representation of the artifacts at the Pulau Saigon site, but one should caution that as there was no excavation undertaken, the proportions also demonstrate the collection bias.
