The PSG site provides a useful source of data for comparison with other assemblages from the colonial era. Many of the artifact types, such as salt-glazed seltzer water bottles and glass bottles with twirled decorations, have not been found in other excavations in the heritage district of Singapore. Some of them may have been destined for people who lived outside the downtown area such as Europeans, whose trash is unlikely to be found because trash was removed from European residential areas on a regular basis and dumped elsewhere. Further comparative research with sites elsewhere, both in Singapore and abroad, will undoubtedly add depth to our understanding of the patterns of consumption hinted at by this data.
