The Fort Canning Dig in 2018 and subsequent explorations on three visits (April, May, and December) in 2019 provided the archaeological team led by Goh and Miksic with the opportunity to explore the dig site further as four new units were opened and the strategy to limit the excavation to only reveal artefacts in the soil as the site is not threatened so that future archaeological work can be continued when required, utilizing better techniques than presently exist, which will enable future archaeologists to derive more information from the site.

The result of proportional analysis of the salvage artefacts is in line with the previous archaeological excavation results conducted since 1984 under Miksic. In terms of quantities (number of sherds) and weight, stoneware comprises the most numerous category followed by porcelain and earthenware. Within the category of porcelain, the data is also consistent with previous findings: green porcelain is proportionately the most common,t followed by white ware, blue and white, and others. Among stoneware, buff stoneware comprises the largest sub-category, followed by brittle ware and mercury jar. Tempered earthenware is more numerous and weighs more than fine paste earthenware. In this regard, the 2018 dig and 2019 explorations add to and support the results and conclusions made by previous excavations and analyses by Miksic and team.

There are however two points to note from this project. First, the three Thai artefacts found are important as only one other Thai artefact had previously been found on Fort Canning Hill. This was a brown and white covered box, which was more commonly produced. The three finds are significant on two counts: 1) the small number of examples suggests that regional products such as the Sawankhalok and Sukhothai might have formed part of items sent as gift exchanges, and 2) the fact that Thai Sawankhalok and Sukhothai ware are found on Fort Canning hill which was used only until the end of the 14th and early 15th centuries also supports the inference that such Thai wares were exported in the late 14th century.

The last remark refers to the fact that the expansion of the excavation to the north and south sections of the dig site yielded finds which suggest that there are more areas on the hill, especially in the Spice Gardens and to south of the site, may still yield finds which can provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the activities which were carried out on the hill during the 14th century.
