II B9: Omar and Ros had a hard time trying to clear the South section closest to the Istana as it was full of big chunks of rock and bricks. Omar decided to dig close to the “column” section of the Istana wall where the soil was much easier to excavate. It was black soil.

Ching Huei informed Omar of a 1824 map of the area. Ching Huei thought that the gatepost he found overgrown by the Banyan tree on the road was part of the “old gate post” at the Istana. But a further check revealed another gatepost, which was also overgrown in the big Banyan tree. There was probably a gateway connected to the an old plot perpendicular to the Istana and adjacent to the Gedong Kuning. Faizal and Lucy showed up at 3pm and began the washing of the artifacts.

Omar used the cangkul to excavate the layer.

Ina came with Mr Ridzwan. Ina went off to get two young volunteers who were two Secondary 3 students. Omar arranged for the two students to try their hand at digging the rubble in II B5 before they shifted to III B10. III B10 contains two visible features which look like postholes.
