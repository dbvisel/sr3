A large quantity of artifacts was recovered from all squares, including pottery, glass, and coins. The excavations yielded a surprisingly wide range of expensive European pottery from England, Scotland, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Other ceramics include a considerable amount of Chinese porcelain and stoneware. Many fragments of local earthenware constitute a valuable resource for the study of this material, little of which has been found at other 19th and 20th century site components in Singapore. The most interesting comparison for the IKG material will be the assemblage from Pulau Saigon, but the artifacts from the upper layers of sites along the Singapore River (PHC, OPH, EMP) may also provide enough samples to perform statistical analyses to determine whether the differences in the proportions of various types of European, Chinese, and local ceramics between the Singapore River and Kampong Gelam are significant enough to detect a distinctive pattern for the IKG site, which might be correlated with cultural preferences of the Malays who formed the majority of the siteâ€™s occupants.

Coins found at the site belong to a wide range of types.  Three Dutch VOC coins found are particularly intriguing.  They were all minted before the VOC went bankrupt in 1799.  They remained in circulation in Singapore during the early years of British occupation (Liew and Wilson 2021: 33-59); more were found at EMP and CCT. Some early Chinese coins were also found, one from Kangxi (1662-1722); another form of currency, a merchant token of the so-called Island of Sultana series (1 _keping_), is dated AH 1219 or 1804 CE].
