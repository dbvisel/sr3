Archaeological research at the Kampong Gelam archaeological site began in March 2000. The main dig was concluded on September 21, 2000, but Mr. Omar Chen, who was employed as a part-time researcher by the Malay Heritage Centre, continued to conduct intermittent excavations in the southeastern corner of the site until June 2003. No detailed records of the later excavations appear to have been kept. This report only covers the main excavation conducted between and March and September 2000. The database accompanying this report however contains data entries for artifacts from both the excavation in 2000 and the later excavations which have found their way into the collection which the authors and their team analyzed and processed.

As usually occurs in Singapore, weather wrought havoc with the excavation at Kampung Gelam. Due to the perfectly flat ground surface and low elevation of the site above sea level, it was impossible to prevent water from flooding the pits and disturbing the profiles of the squares. Nevertheless it was possible in some areas to detect soil features indicative of probable single depositional events such as digging of trash pits. 

On 15 March 2000, grids were laid out on all four sides of the palace. Another grid was laid out in the southeast corner of the Istanaâ€™s walled compound.  This area, Square V, proved to contain remains of the foundation of a separate structure. On March 17, a _doa selamat_ (prayer for safety) was conducted in accordance with Malay custom, after which excavation commenced.
