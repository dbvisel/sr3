To date, we have analyzed a total of 1,495 sherds of Chinese porcelain (17.88kg), 159 Japanese porcelain sherds (2.8kg), 3,492 European porcelain sherds (41.45kg), 97 Other porcelain sherds (14.44kg), 246 Chinese stoneware sherds (7.7kg), 9 European stoneware sherds (3.8kg), 1,479 local earthenware sherds (30.3kg), two Other stoneware sherds (32g), five  sherds of Yixing teapots (24g), 389 glass artifacts (12.2kg), 158 stone artifacts (2.7kg), 198 metal artifacts (5.8kg), 502 organic biofacts (3.9kg), 538 pieces of construction material (4.2kg), and 4 plastic items (12.2g). It is important to note that the data presented in this report and database represent only a fraction of the total number of artifacts in the IKG assemblage. It is hoped that more analysis of this assemblage will be conducted in future.

## Statistics of the IKG Artifacts

The statistics presented constitute approximately 30%-40% of all artifacts in the IKG collection. This report presents a preliminary statistical tally of the types of artifacts excavated from the IKG site. The bulk of the artifacts under analysis came from the 2000 IKG dig; there is a small proportion of IKG artifacts from a 2003 dig which were stored together with the 2000 IKG artifacts. Mr. Omar Chen, who was then working at the Taman Warisan, and another individual carried out a dig in 2003 at the Istana Kampung Gelam site, but do not appear to have documented their excavation or their finds. The authors of this report and the team noted bags of artifacts bearing tags from the 2003 and proceeded to process them despite the absence of precise information regarding their context at the site. The
