Empress Place, like the other sites on the plain north of the Singapore River, was occupied during the 14th through 16th centuries. A wide variety of Chinese porcelain from the Ming Dynasty is quite plentiful at Empress Place. This is significant in view of the rarity of Chinese porcelain from the 15th century outside of China. This data reinforces the hypothesis that the harbourmaster mentioned in the map of 1604 probably lived on or near this site. 

Artifacts from Vietnam, Thailand, Java, Borneo, the Philippines, China, and Persia are consistent with the description of EMP as a site where goods from much of maritime Asia were loaded, unloaded, and transhipped.
