<Figure caption="Figure 46. Lead statue depicting a figure riding a winged horse in <em>wayang kulit</em> style." img={"Figure_46_headless_rider_hires.jpg"} />

This is one of the most important objects yet discovered in Singapore. It is the only known statue made of lead in ancient Southeast Asia. Its stylized depiction of a man on a winged horse is also unique, both in artistry and subject matter. It can most closely be compared to stone relief carvings from 14th-century East Java. This image together with the terracotta head found at EMP reinforce historical sources which portray Temasek as part of the Majapahit empire. The theme of a man riding on a winged horse echoes the legend of Raja Chulan in the _Malay Annals/Sejarah Melayu_. He was an Indian ruler who visited Temasek, explored a kingdom beneath the Singapore Strait, sired three princes, one of whom changed the island’s name to Singapore, and returned to the mouth of the Singapore River on a winged horse.
