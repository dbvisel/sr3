[Insert Figure 46 headless rider hires.jpg]
Figure 46. Lead statue depicting a figure riding a winged horse in _wayang kulit_ style.

This is one of the most important objects yet discovered in Singapore. It is the only known statue made of lead in ancient Southeast Asia. Its stylized depiction of a man on a winged horse is also unique, both in artistry and subject matter. It can most closely be compared to stone relief carvings from 14th-century East Java. This image together with the terracotta head found at EMP reinforce historical sources which portray Temasek as part of the Majapahit empire. The theme of a man riding on a winged horse echoes the legend of Raja Chulan in the _Malay Annals/Sejarah Melayu_. He was an Indian ruler who visited Temasek, explored a kingdom beneath the Singapore Strait, sired three princes, one of whom changed the islandâ€™s name to Singapore, and returned to the mouth of the Singapore River on a winged horse.
