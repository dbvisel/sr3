In 1990 it was decided to convert the building to an exhibition space. No archaeological research was conducted, but 14th-century artifacts were visible in trenches dug beneath what is now a road between the Asian Civilisations Museum and Victoria Concert Hall. Some of these were collected by members of the public who passed by on weekends when no construction was in progress. At this time there was no formal archaeology program in Singapore.
