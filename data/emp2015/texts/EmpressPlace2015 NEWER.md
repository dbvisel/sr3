## 1. Introduction to the Site
The ISEAS Archaeology Unit (AU) excavated the Empress Place (EMP) site from 2 February 2015 to 12 April 2015. This was conducted during construction works to repurpose the open lawn in front of the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall into a plaza, to commemorate the bicentenary (SG50) of Singapore’s independence !(Figure \1)[images/Figure1.jpg]. The transplanting of mature rain trees, which require substantial earthworks, posed the main concern for archaeologists who, eight months prior (2014), found 14th-century deposits after excavating two test pits at the site. As in situ preservation was not considered an option by the developers, a large-scale rescue excavation was made possible with funding and support from the National Heritage Board (NHB), the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the Ministry of National Development, as well as private donors. Members of the public and from various institutions such as the Probation Services, the Ministry of Social Services, and the Ministry of Defence also provided fieldwork assistance. With additional funding from the NHB, this post-excavation report aims to provide technical information about the excavation as well as a sample baseline dataset of the finds for further research.

### 1.1. Summary of the History of the EMP Site
Panoramic sketches of Singapore’s southern landform were done by an unknown artist, during a hydrographic survey in February and April of 1819. These sketches include the earliest visual depiction of the EMP area ![Figure 2: The April 1819 sketch of Singapore’s southern landform on the north shore of the Singapore River (Langdon and Kwa 2010).](images/Figure 2.jpg). This would have been around the time when Sir Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore, to sign a treaty with Temenggong Abdul Rahman, to establish the East India Company trading post in the area. The artist's impression of early Singapore provides us with an idea of what Temasek may have looked like in the 14th century. It is on this land demarcated by the coast, the Singapore River, the Stamford Canal, and Fort Canning Hill that archaeologists believe the ancient settlement was located. Providing clues about the settlement’s late form and layout—although not drawn to scale—is the 1820 hand-painted Bute Archives map. The map indicates that the Temenggong’s palace—densely surrounded by the homes of his subjects and accessible by a main roadway—occupies the EMP site ![Figure 3: The 1820 Bute Archive Mount Stuart map showing the configuration and layout of the Temenggong’s palace on the north shore of the Singapore River (Lim 2015).](images/Figure 3.jpg). According to a summary of British cartography of the area (Lim 2015), it is clear that a variety of administrative buildings and institutions existed before the 1864 construction of the Empress Place building, which is now the current location of the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM). After being relocated to Telok Blangah by order of Raffles in 1823, the former palace site on the north riverbank was reclaimed for the construction of European-style brick and mortar buildings such as a Police Office and a Court House ![Figure 4: ‘Map of the Town and Environs of Singapore’ 1836 (Lim 2015).](images/Figure 4.jpg). The latter was eventually expanded or rebuilt by 1846 to include the Fives Court and other buildings that were added for storing coal and food, and to provide postal services ![Figure 5: ‘Plan of Singapore Town and Adjoining Districts’ 1846 (Lim 2015).](images/Figure 5.jpg).

Another decade later saw the construction of the Town Hall establishing the site’s significance as the colonial administrative centre (Figure 6). Between 1864 and 1867, more buildings such as the Government Offices (present ACM building) were added (Figure 7). To cater to growing needs, the building’s capacity was transformed by extensions in 1880, 1908, and 1920. It was also around 1907 that the Government Office and its vicinity was officially known—in tribute to Queen Victoria—as the Empress Place Building and Empress Place respectively. In addition to the Government Secretariat, essential services such as the Public Works Department, Medical Department, and Treasury and Stamp Office can be found here. Its functions changed over time, which included the Printing Office, Post Office, Marine Police, Master Attendant’s Office, the Lower Courts, the Supreme Court, the Council’s Chambers and the General Assembly Hall for the community. It is notable that the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Citizenship Registry, and the Immigration Department of Singapore remained in the Empress Place Building until the 1980s. In addition, historical events such as the visits by Lord Dalhousie, Governor-General of India in February 1850 and the Siamese King Chulalongkorn in 1871 are now forever marked by the Dalhousie Obelisk and a bronze elephant statue respectively (for their original location refer to Figure 8). The former, which was erected adjacent to the Dalhousie Pier several hundred yards away, was moved in 1890 to its present location to make way for the construction of Connaught Drive. The bronze elephant statue on the other hand was moved in 1919 from the Town Hall to its current location outside the Empress Place Building. The other monument that defined the EMP site is the Victoria Memorial Hall that was built in 1903 and the repurposing of the adjacent Town Hall in 1906 into the Victoria Theatre. Although it has been recorded that developments were done on these buildings for post World War II reconstructions, in 1979, and in 2010, these did not significantly alter their architectural footprints  (Figure 9). More important, is the preservation of the open space next to these buildings. For a long time, the EMP site was a major traffic intersection (Figure 10) before becoming a car park in the postwar decades. It was later landscaped into a lawn more than 40 years ago. Notwithstanding the introduction of underground services, such relatively undeveloped spaces, like the Padang, are rare in Singapore and can potentially contain archaeological deposits.

### 1.2. Summary of the archaeology around the EMP site
Since 1984, archaeologists have excavated at least ten major 14th century sites (Lim 2019, 2017, 2015; Miksic 2013) within 84 hectares of the downtown City Hall area. Archaeological deposits in this area are typically found near or within the grounds of national monuments or land that remain relatively underdeveloped compared to their surroundings. Opportunities to conduct slow and detailed research excavations are however rare, as most excavations are rescue (development-led) in nature and are, as a result, limited in time, resources, and accessibility to the sites. Consequently, the scope of rescue projects unavoidably centres on the recovery of the oldest artefacts and lesser on the other important aspects of archaeology. This is regrettable because excavations are irreversible. And because of the differing circumstances that affect the way these sites are excavated and documented, intra-site analysis is not always a straightforward matter. Despite the challenging situation of Singapore archaeology and the fact that development (since colonial times) has dwindled the extent of archaeological deposits in downtown urban spaces, significant amounts of deposits such as those found at EMP may still be present. Other examples include Fort Canning, the Old Parliament House, the Parliament House Complex, Empress Place (1998), the Colombo Court, the Singapore Cricket Club, the St. Andrews Cathedral, the National Gallery Singapore, and the Victoria Concert Hall. Evidence has shown that these sites are once part of an economically driven Malay kingdom called Temasek or Singapura that was founded in around 1299 (Miksic 2013, 154). According to Miksic (1985), Fort Canning Hill (formerly known as Government Hill and Bukit Larangan), which overlook the entrance of the Singapore River was an elite residence while the other sites located across the sandy coastal plain—separating the hill from the sea—characterise its seafaring community. Like many archaeological sites around the world, the inorganic nature of ceramics mean that this category of artefacts form the bulk of the artefact assemblage that survive and it is apparent from the abundance and the variety of Chinese stoneware and porcelain, in particular, that Temasek was an important and vibrant place. By considering the pattern of similarities and differences between the ceramics found in Singapore and other contemporaneous nearby sites, it appears that Temasek—with its strategic location and natural harbour—served as an entrepôt along the monsoon-driven Maritime Silk Road that has linked merchants and seafaring communities of East Asia and West Asia for more than a millennium (Miksic 2013, 2004, 2000). 

Research has also shown that despite Temasek’s decline after a prosperous reign of more than a century, people were still living at the settlement and maintaining their links to Melaka, Johor, Riau and other important places in the Malay Archipelago (Kwa et al. 2018; Borschberg 2010). Unlike the density of 14th century deposits, the archaeological record of the later period(s) is often more subtle and as a result underrepresented in archaeological research. This deficiency also highlights the fact that in order for one to contextualize Singapore in regional history, one must consider the multitude of maritime societies that formed the longue durée of island Southeast Asia (Andaya 2006; Solheim, Bulbeck, and Flavel 2006; Manguin 2001) and an example of this can be found in the historical richness of the Orang Laut that used to thrive in the Singapore and Johor Strait. By tracing their unique way of life, one may argue that perhaps a Maritime Cultural Landscape perspective (Westerdahl 2012; Ford 2011a; Westerdahl 1992)—as opposed to a site-specific perspective—is a more appropriate approach to studying Singapore’s past. At the same time, while the study of long-distance trade, i.e. Chinese ceramics remain important; a fixation on this topic can limit the archaeological narrative. For instance, it is believed that ancient activities in Singapore such as pottery making (Kao 2021), glass recycling (Miksic 2013, 343–348; 1995), and the presence of workshops for gold and other metal products (Zaini 2019; Miksic 2013, 283)—although more subtle in the archaeological record—meant that long-distance trade is surely not all that can be said about ancient Singapore. And based on more recent excavations, site-function such as a market and a residential zone can be distinguished at the Victoria Concert Hall site (Lim 2019) and the National Gallery Singapore Site (Lim 2017) respectively. Clearly, it is the combination of all these inferences, which allow researchers to portray a less limited understanding of Temasek.


## 2. Excavation Methodology
The EMP excavation comprises three main components. This section outlines the various aspects that form the evaluation test pits, the watching brief and the rescue excavation.

### 2.1. Evaluation Test Pits
A three-day excavation was carried out in June 2014 to profile the soil stratigraphy of the site and to determine the presence (or absence) of archaeological deposits (Figure 11). The manual excavation of two test pits measuring 2 metres by 1 metre was spaced randomly apart—one on each end of the western and eastern sections of the lawn—to estimate the horizontal extent of archaeological deposits, if any. At about 170 to 200 centimetres below the surface, a fine black sandy stratum—typical of Temasek deposits and containing a variety of 14th-century ceramics (Figure 12)—was encountered in both test pits. Sieving of the soil heap also uncovered small finds. More importantly, the test pits provided archaeologists with information on how far these deposits were from the surface.

### 2.2. Watching Brief
Fullerton Road essentially bounds the EMP excavation site to the north, while the Empress Place (road), the Dalhousie Obelisk and the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall mark the southern, eastern and western limits respectively (Figure 13). To accommodate the eight rain trees that were originally planted along Fullerton Road, the developer assigned arbitrary Zones 1 to 9 (west of the obelisk) for transplanting. This area will later become the main excavation area for archaeologists. The other areas affected by earthworks consist of Zone 10 (east of the obelisk) and Zones 11 to 13 (north-end of the site). A watching brief occurred at the start of construction during the removal of topsoil for the insertion of sheet piles into the ground (Figure 14). The three-metre depth needed for transplanting meant that sheet piles are a safety requirement for all of the zones. Other than scant traces of the more recent colonial period, nothing remarkable was seen during the watching brief. Underlying much of the landscaping topsoil is the historical roadway and construction fill that is contained in a matrix of clayey sand. After much of this modern fill material was removed, archaeologists became concerned when mechanical excavators dug up fine black Temasek sand deposits (Figure 15). The machines were prevented from digging deeper and at least 20 centimetres of the overlying soil and debris was left in situ to protect the archaeological deposits. Following the establishment of the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) precise level benchmark (80153)—located at the Cavenagh Bridge—as the archaeological site datum, the start depth of pre-modern deposits was determined at 130–150 CMBD (centimetres below datum). Other than the main excavation area, archaeologists were not granted access to work in the other zones. This is regrettable as archaeological deposits were later found in these areas as well as in a series of trenches that were dug for drainage and utility diversion. Not particularly helpful were the random finds collected by construction workers.

### 2.3. Rescue excavation
As previously mentioned, the main excavation area, measuring 70 metres by 13 metres, is made up of zones 1 to 9 (Figure 16). Archaeologists excavated only zones 3 to 4 and 7 to 9, which were divided into 23 excavation units measuring either 5 metres by 5 metres or 5 metres by 4 metres. With regard to zones 1 to 2 and 5 to 6, contractors destroyed these areas before archaeologists could excavate them (Figure 17). Fortunately (or unfortunately), salvage screening recovered about 600 kg of artefacts—with no primary provenience—from the spoil heaps of zones 5 to 6. This artefact mass constitutes 20% of the entire EMP artefact yield. After gridding the main excavation area, the controlled digging of 20-centimetre spits using handheld tools and trowels started at a depth of 130 CMBD. When time allowed for the more detailed documentation of interesting features, diggers excavated in spits of 10 cm. Screening of the spoils using 6 mm and 3 mm wire mesh began once the upper protective layer was removed or when the pre-modern sandy stratum was encountered. Excavation forms, scaled drawings, and photography completed the documentation, and this work cycle proceeded until no more artefacts were found. Being first and foremost a construction site, disruption to archaeology was frequent. For example, work in the excavation units was halted whenever a tree was being transplanted and, on one other occasion, breached water mains inundated several excavation units, causing damage and work to be halted for half a day. Clearly, whenever possible, archaeology must precede construction. Out of the total area affected by construction work (2,273 m²), only 19.57% (445 m²)—inside the main excavation area—was systematically excavated and documented. Of the areas not excavated by archaeologists, only 18.48% (420 m²) was supervised by limited amounts of watching briefs. This meant that, notwithstanding the area already intruded by underground services, more than half of the total area affected by earthworks was not documented by archaeology.

## 3. Results
This section presents the data and the provisional interpretation of the finds that were sampled from excavation units EMP 001 to EMP 007 for this report.

A total of 160,957 artefacts, weighing 890 kg, were processed for this report. By area, the adjacent units of EMP 001 to EMP 007 form at least 17% of the main excavation area (refer to Figure 16). Except for EMP 002 and EMP 007, which are 5-metre grids, the other units are 5 metres by 4 metres. The archaeological integrity of most of the units was not optimal at the time of excavation. A modern underground pipe bisected at least 40% of EMP 002 and EMP 007, while 70% of EMP 003, 90% of EMP 005, and 20% of EMP 007 was destroyed by construction work. Unit 1001 is a much smaller unit that was excavated before contractors installed a steel support column that bordered EMP 001 and EMP 006. Due to time constraints, the artefacts from this particular unit remain unprocessed. These factors must be considered when comparisons between the units are drawn. Despite the compromising circumstances, well-preserved deposits and features are still considerable, especially in EMP 001, EMP 004, and EMP 006. Chronologically speaking, only a small percentage (<1%) of the artefacts are attributed to the colonial period as systematic excavations only occurred at the stratigraphic transition between the colonial layer and the underlying pre-modern layer. Typical colonial artefacts such as 'European stoneware', 'earthenware white', and 'CBM' (Ceramic Building Material) are few to none. As such, the data in this report is representative of the pre-modern period.

### 3.1. Artefact distribution and variety
In summary (Figure 18), ceramic artefacts form the bulk of the assemblage with stoneware types forming the largest group of ceramics (34% by mass), followed not far by earthenware (28%) and porcelain (<1%). In comparison to the total ceramic yield between Temasek sites, the high proportion of earthenware at EMP is notable. While porcelain by contrast appears unremarkable, these important artefacts are still found in every excavation unit (Figure 19). Its small mass considers that celadons (and certain white-glazed vessels) are after all not considered porcelains. Researchers with a different approach may combine these figures. Until more detailed analysis tells us otherwise, the style of the porcelains provides us with a 14th/-17th-century pre-modern time frame (Figure 20). Unusually high at the same time, is the proportion of non-ceramic artefacts (37.4%). This is because more than half of the non-ceramic artefacts (31.5%) are made up of 'geological' artefacts. The stone objects are incidentally the highest typological contributor. Contextually speaking, a majority of the stone artefacts are part of a non-portable archaeological feature (this will be explained further in the next section) and had their recovery not been selective, this figure would be much higher. Other non-ceramic artefacts that were often encountered are metal (3.3%) and faunal material (2.5%). Subsequent to 'geological' artefacts, 'earthenware tempered' is the second highest contributor (27.7%), followed by 'stoneware others' (22.9%), 'stoneware greenware' (6.2%), and 'stoneware XKP' (3.4%). 

As a dominant variety of material culture, the unusually high proportion of 'earthenware tempered' distinguishes EMP from other Temasek sites. It is not uncommon for the weight of stoneware from other riverbank sites to be more than twice that of earthenware (Goh and Miksic 2021, 2020; Miksic and Goh 2003; Lim 2019, 2017). Furthermore, the breakdown of stoneware from these site reports excludes celadons and white-glazed stoneware, which are classified as porcelains. The higher volume of earthenware at EMP may have implications on site function and activities. Many of the EMP earthenware are wide-mouth cooking pots (Figure 21) and globular storage vessels, usually accompanied by a modest amount of fine paste vessels (<1%). Some of the more unique 'earthenware tempered' decorations feature striking similarities with Johor Lama specimens (Solheim and Green 1966; Gibson-Hill 1955). Recent studies have also shown that a significant proportion of the 'earthenware tempered' found in Singapore are not locally made and further analysis could potentially reveal more about ancient Singapore’s maritime links (Kao 2021). Recovered at EMP are the fragments of possible oven moulds (Figure 22) used for producing staple sago-based food items such as sagu lempeng. According to Ellen and Latinis (Ellen and Latinis 2012; Latinis 2004), such implements are unique to East Indonesia, particularly Maluku in the past. Although further analysis of the assemblage is required to determine whether these artefacts are random shipboard utensils found on land or part of the local culture and economy, their association with food production at EMP is apparent. Researchers also believe that their distribution may be linked to the trade in spices such as nutmeg and cloves (Ibid). In addition, the presence of charcoal, shells, and animal bones (Figure 23) in midden features strongly suggests that food preparation and consumption may have been widespread at the site. This is not only confirmed by the presence of what appears to be the remains of earthenware stoves (Figure 24), but also numerous stone implements that are shaped from a variety of sedimentary and igneous rocks for grinding and pounding and whetstone sharpening (Figure 25). Rare at the same time are the carbonised remains of betel nuts (areca catechu) that were found near or within the midden features. The absence of their tough protective outer layer suggests that the seeds were not naturally occurring but were de-husked for consumption (Figure 26). Their presence also suggests that large amounts of organic items were likely present but have not survived. 

Furthering our understanding of the site is the large quantity of goods that were transported between ship and shore to be traded or used and disposed of. These range from Cizhou wares to storage jars and bowls from Guangdong and Fujian province (Figure 27) to exquisite Jingdezhen blue-and-white, Qingbai, and Dehua porcelains, as well as regular and higher-grade Longquan celadons (Figure 28) from Zhejiang. In terms of more personal items, hundreds of Chinese coins (Figure 29), including high-value currency and objects such as a gold coin (Figure 30) and gold wire artefacts, were recovered (Lim 2015). However, it is unfortunate that these artefacts are not in the collection of the Archaeology Unit at ISEAS and little information about them is available. Other rare and intimate finds include fragmentary palm-size Qingbai ceramic figurines, the significance of which at EMP remains a subject of further enquiry (Heng 2020), as well as jewellery beads and bangles made from stone and glass (Figure 31). Other fragile objects made from glass, although uncommon, are scattered across the sampled units. Interestingly, the artefact proportion between the units and the arbitrary layers does not differ significantly (Figure 32). This confirms the integrity of the provenance, which not only provides researchers with a wider and more robust range of sampling, but also the possibility to examine and determine the extent of specific activities and the more minute differences in site usage. Furthermore, based on the vertical artefact distribution, it is apparent that the 150 CMBD to 170 CMBD layers—featuring a spike in artefacts—reflect the peak in site occupation. Although it is yet unclear how long this period lasted, the overlying 130 CMBD to 150 CMBD layers appear to suggest that even with decline—presumably in trade and activity—people’s preference in material culture, namely pottery, did not change significantly over time. However, more research is needed to nuance any subtleties. Ultimately, the preservation of each layer enables researchers to examine various demographic changes, if any, and material consumption throughout time and space.

### 3.2. Archaeological Features
Distinct concentrations of artefacts were documented in EMP 001, EMP 003, EMP 004, EMP 006, and EMP 007 (Refer back to Figure 16). Of notable interest is the steep rise and fall of artefacts in Feature A of EMP 001 (Figure 33) that seems to indicate that the midden was either used intermittently or perhaps organic matter that was present has since decomposed. This may also be a by-product of a site formation process that is undetermined at this moment. This feature intrudes into the neighbouring units of EMP 004 and EMP 006. Similar features, albeit smaller in size and yet to be examined in detail, are also present in EMP 006 and EMP 007. Large shells were concentrated in the latter. Towards the south of the sampled units, a very pronounced colonial drainpipe feature extends across EMP 003 and EMP 004 and beyond the main excavation area towards the ACM building. Partially disturbed before its discovery is a midden containing a significant amount of shell and bone and other inorganic material that was situated along the south profile of EMP 003. Although the excavated area of EMP 003 is one of the smallest, this feature, which extends beyond the unit under the modern roadway, contains the highest amount of faunal artefacts consisting of coral, shells, and animal bones. Underlying the colonial drainpipe feature and spanning the length of EMP 004 is a large concentration of 14th-century artefacts (Figure 34). Its full potential remains undocumented because the neighbouring unit (EMP 008) was destroyed by construction work. It is the richness of this midden, including the rest of EMP 004, that yielded the most artefacts by mass (34%). The volume of earthenware and stoneware in this unit is exceptional. At least 40% of all the earthenware (tempered) and stoneware (combined) recovered from all the sampled units is found in EMP 004. The artefacts from this unit are also found in considerable depth of up to 240 CMBD. From here, we may hypothetically assume that these artefacts are representative of the site’s earliest occupation. 

Of notable interest is the contrast between the gradual accumulation of material culture in the earlier period (170 CMBD to 240 CMBD) and the abrupt decline (130 CMBD to 150 CMBD) presumably after the peak in trade and activities (refer to EMP 004 chart in Figure 32). More analysis is needed to determine if this anomaly is reflective of a mass exodus from Temasek at the end of its reign or simply an effect of past and recent site formation processes. Based on the similar artefact distribution pattern reflected in the neighbouring units (including the midden features), the former scenario is highly plausible.

## 4. The Wider Significance of the Site
Buried under the shores of today's Singapore River are the remains of a much older civilisation. Indeed, the EMP excavation, like many digs of recent years, adds another piece to the archaeological puzzle. It is clear from the abundance of 14th-century artefacts that the site forms an integral part of the Temasek settlement. Based on the largest collection of pre-modern artefacts recovered on land, the yield reflects how busy this area near the original entrance of the river must have been in ancient times. While the provisional understanding of the assemblage appears not unusual for a Temasek site, it is crucial to examine its wider context and how certain aspects of it are evidenced by the archaeological features that interdigitate the site. When compared with the 1998 EMP excavation (Miksic 2013: 245–252), the 100-metre proximity of the two sites represents an important area between the intertidal mark and the upper riverbank respectively. Conceptually speaking (Ford 2011b; Rainbird 2007), this is the liminal space that marks the transition between land and water and more significantly, the place where seafarers and objects start or end their voyage. For thousands of years, despite its danger, the sea remains a place of mystery, knowledge, and opportunity. Regardless of geography and beliefs, this enigmatic and almost universal attraction meant that the mental and physical topography of the coast dwells deeply and meaningfully within most maritime societies whose perspectives at times can be constrained by limitations in traditional archaeology. Maritime archaeology recognises the contiguity of the coast between maritime-land sites and underwater sites. In consideration of this, Temasek is physically defined not only by terrestrial sites, but also by its harbour, geography, geology, landmarks, marine biodiversity, and shipwreck sites. There are also intangible aspects (see, for example, Westerdahl 1992) that remain unexplored. In this case, excavations in or near waterlogged urban areas such as EMP are challenging but important, because the heavily trafficked site can potentially tell us more about the character of the port and how it functioned. What makes this site significant and unique are the remains of port-related features that were, regrettably, excavated and documented in an expeditious manner.

Interestingly, a large amount of rocks of relatively similar scale (Figure 35) were found—densely associated at times—throughout the main excavation area. It thus formed a feature (Figure 36) that was straddled by earlier and more recent deposition of artefacts (refer to Figure 32). Although the belated discovery of this feature means that it was not entirely documented, it is apparent to archaeologists that the occurrence of these rocks is unnatural and it is plausible that if some of these were not abandoned ship ballasts, they may have been a foundation of sorts for roadways, timber-and-thatch structures, or even a pier. The use of rocks as a foundational substrate is not uncommon at that time and can be found, for example, in Johor Lama and Trawas (east Java). It is also possible that these sandstones were obtainable on the opposite side of the Singapore River mouth, in an area called Rocky Point by the British in 1819. This was also where the Singapore Stone stood originally. Intriguingly, the depth of this feature coincides with the layer containing the highest volume of 14th-century artefacts (150 CMBD to 170 CMBD). This suggests that the feature is associated with a time when Temasek was most active as a port. Clearly, the horizontal distribution of rocks in this layer goes beyond the main excavation area and its occurrence represents an important aspect of Temasek that is not previously documented. Preserved at the same time in waterlogged anaerobic soil is a pair of timber boxes (Figure 37) with similar dimension and construction, and was of significant burial depth. Interestingly, some of the planks exhibit dowel-edge-joints used in traditional Southeast Asian boatbuilding (Figure 39). The four-sided metre-square boxes were held in the ground by simple box joints and vertically driven wooden pegs (Figure 39). Despite the fact that its function remains unknown, it is clear that good quality timber was repurposed from run-down boats. The repetition and spacing of the features indicate that they were not random but, like the rock feature, they may be of economic use. It is possible that more of these as well as other features remain buried nearby. 

The boat planks represent the first ever fragments of a ship-on-land wreck (see, for example, Delgado 2012) in Singapore. Its multiple contexts suggest that, while it is yet unclear whether there was boatbuilding nearby, disused vessels were certainly dismantled. Although the timber features are not found within the sampled units of this report, their presentation and discussion are necessary for site context. Notable at the same time is the fact that archaeological features of similar nature were not found in nearby digs or were perhaps disregarded or unintentionally missed. The presence of 16th-17th-century porcelain confirms that the site was not entirely abandoned after its century-long reign and that the careful analyses of each arbitrary layer, hypothetically speaking, may nuance the little-known chronological subtleties of pre-modern Singapore. This is a historical aspect that is clearly understudied. Also, in terms of the more recent period, it is unfortunate that the excavation was situated in the midst of construction work and had to be excavated expeditiously. This overlooked what is clearly the overlying colonial stratum and compromised to a certain extent the excavation of the pre-modern deposits.
